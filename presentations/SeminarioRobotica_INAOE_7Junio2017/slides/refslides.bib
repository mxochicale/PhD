@article{Frank2010,
abstract = {Activity recognition based on data from mobile wearable devices is becoming an important application area for machine learning. We propose a novel approach based on a combination of feature extraction using time-delay embedding and supervised learning. The computational requirements are considerably lower than existing approaches, so the processing can be done in real time on a low-powered portable device such as a mobile phone. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on a large, noisy data set comprising over 50 hours of data from six different subjects, including activities such as running and walking up or down stairs. We also demonstrate the ability of the system to accurately classify an individual from a set of 25 people, based only on the characteristics of their walking gait. The system requires very little parameter tuning, and can be trained with small amounts of data.},

@article{Frank2012,
abstract = {We present a novel framework for analysing univariate time series data. At the heart of the approach is a versatile algorithm for measuring the similarity of two segments of time series called geometric template matching (GeTeM). First, we use GeTeM to compute a similarity measure for clustering and nearest-neighbour classification. Next, we present a semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses the similarity measure with hierarchical clustering in order to improve classification performance when unlabelled training data is available. Finally, we present a boosting framework called TDEBOOST, which uses an ensemble of GeTeM classifiers. TDEBOOST augments the traditional boosting approach with an additional step, in which the features used as inputs to the classifier are adapted at each step to improve the training error. We empirically evaluate the proposed approaches on several datasets, such as accelerometer data collected from wearable sensors and ECG data.},

@article{Sama2013,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel gait recognition method which uses the signals measured by a single inertial sensor located on the waist. This method considers human gait as a dynamical system and employs a few singular values obtained by means of Singular Spectrum Analysis applied to scalar measurements from the inertial sensor. Singular values can be interpreted as the approximate edge length of the bounding box wrapping the attractor in the latent space. Effects of different parameters on the gait recognition performance using patterns from 20 different subjects are analysed. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
