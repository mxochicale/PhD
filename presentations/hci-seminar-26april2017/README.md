If we have three different people saying "I would like to drink water" 
and certainly we will find different measurements but is it possible 
to find HIGHER LEVELS ABSTRACTIONS which corresponds to phonemes and that 
can not only apply in speech but in sign language where you can have
three different persons saying in "how are you today?"

Is it possible to find different levels of abstractions than compress some
very high dimensional vector space?

What are the overall aims of your research?
Well, the aim of my PhD is to create metrics to measure variability 

"but WHY?" that is actually a very good question.

Are you interested more about people or more about measurements

#### [Charlie Pinder](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~cxp291/)'s comments [31:53]
Do you have any measurament of peoples' motivation?

Also a metric for the level of understanding when people is imitation the robot? (Rowanne's comment)

If, for instance, you watch children dancing or doing gynmastics, they would try 
to reproduce somethig BUT, there are two separate things 
(a) one is the perception of what they are suppose to do and 
(b) the other is their execution of that.
A lot of the time when the children did something wrong is because of the perception 
of what they are trying to do is incorrect

What the persons seems to be doing is 
is not what the person is expected to be doing but they are doing quite consistenly

#### MY CRITICTS. 
Englihs Language: I believe that my English language speaking skills are still far from good.  I am certainly sure that finding the appropriate words to express what is in one's mind is challenging. I will try to get rid of 'basically' which I used quite a lot in the presentation.  
Presentation: When explaining the time series from inertial sensors, it would be good for the eyes of the audience to zoom the areas where variability is more noticeable.
