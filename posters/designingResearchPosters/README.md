# Poster design workshop

Thursday, 23rd February 2017
Westmere  Seminar room (G15 on Campus Map)

Instructors:  
Megan Field: mxf551@bham.ac.uk
Marcelo Blumenfeld: mxb455@bham.ac.uk

##### What I get

This are some of the ideas that I get from the workshop

* Simple Layout (things are easy to read and to understand)
* Convey your idea, start from the LOGO
* Have something that the audience don't have to read
* Your poster should be read and understood in less than ten minutes
* Putting information in bullets form is better than using sentences
* When you change the backgrounds, you automatically create another section
* Create tension in the design of the poster. For instance, when you drive the
centre line in the highway create such tension.
* Using the Golden Ratio to create tension http://www.arbelos.co.uk/TMCposters.html#2011

* How things flow in your poster?
* How to persuade the eye?

# TODO
