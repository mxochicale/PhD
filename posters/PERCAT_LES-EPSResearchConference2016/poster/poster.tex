\headerbox{Introduction}{name=problem,span=2,column=0,row=0}{

Variability is an inherent characteristic of human movement \cite{newell93}.
Generally, humans perform the same action slightly differently trial by trial
which is a common challenge in Human Activity Recogtion (HAR) \cite{bulling2014}.
The time-delay embedding theorem and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have proven to be
reliable methods for feature extraction in HAR \cite{frank10, sama13}. 
It is therefore hypothesised that these methods might be useful to learn 
the variability of human activities. 
Therefore, the following research questions will be addressed: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Can we use the movement variability 
 not only to identify an activity but also to use it 
 as a index of user's performance
 over the course of training, practice or rehabilitation?
 
  \item How can the time-delay embedding and PCA methods quantify the variability of human activities?
\end{itemize}



% We belive that this prelimary study can give insight into the variability
% For these reasons we are interested in studying methods that can give insight 
% into the variability between individuals and repetitions of the same movement. 
% We believe that this preliminary study might provide useful information for 
% activity recognition, e.g. in terms of detecting changes 
% of user's behaviour (enthusiasm, boredom, tiredness or confusion) in 
% the way in which activities are performed over the course of training, 
% practice or rehabilitation.

\headerbox{Human Activity Recognition Chain}{name=arc,span=2,column=0,below=problem}{

Bulling \emph{et al.} \cite{bulling2014}, for instance, reviewed the state-of-the-art of
Human Activity Recognition to identify activities or gestures from body-worn intertial sensors.

\headerbox{Materials and Methods}{name=methods,span=2,column=0,below=arc}{

Raw time-series data is collected from a triaxial accelerometer ($a_x, a_y, a_z$).
Then, a $N$ samples length time-series, e.g. $a_x$, is used to obtain the
time-delay embedded matrix, $E \{ a_x \}$, with $m=20$ and $\tau=6$ \cite{frank10, sama13}.
Finally, PCA is applied to  $E \{ a_x \}$ to compute 
the percentage of cumulative energy (PCE) \cite{nhammerla11}.




\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{method_diagram01} 
\end{center}


The method is then applied to six simple movements 
which were performed by five participants wearing a low-cost and commertial intertial sensor on their right wrist; 
each movement was continuously repeated for 10 seconds.

}

\headerbox{Conclusion and Outlook}{name=conclusion,span=2,column=0,below=methods}{

% Measuring variability in human activity
% offers an approach to understand user's performence over the course of training, 
% practice or rehabilitation.

Although the time-delay embedding technique is subject to different values of embedded parameters 
( $m$ and $\tau$ ) according to the length and complexity of the time-series,
the technique is useful to present the inherent features of
variability between five participants for six different
gestures.

In the future, we will collect data from a wider range of individuals
(gender and age) and from additional sensors.
Also, different classification techniques will be explored.

The values of the percentage of cumulative energy (PCE) from five participants 
are presented using boxplots for both low-cost and commertial triaxial accelerometer (ACC) sensors.
It is evident that both sensors present similar results for each movement.
It is highlighted that the circular movement shows the least variation of ACC 
per component compare to the other movements. 

However, 
we assume that the evident variability of the movements 
is due to the flexibility in the experiment where participants
were only asked to perform the movements at a comfortable speed.
