\headerbox{Problem}{name=problem,column=0,row=0}{
Variability is an inherent characteristic of human movement \cite{newell93}.
Generally, humans perform the same action slightly differently trial by trial.
For these reasons we are interested in studying methods that can give insight 
into the variability between individuals and repetitions of the same movement. 
We believe that this preliminary study might provide useful information for 
activity recognition, e.g. in terms of detecting changes 
of user's behaviour (enthusiasm, boredom, tiredness or confusion) in 
the way in which activities are performed over the course of training, 
practice or rehabilitation.

\headerbox{Activity Recognition}{name=arc,column=0,below=problem}{

Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) for intertial sensors \cite{banos2014}
where traditional feature extraction techniques are 
time domain, frequency domain and discrete domain \cite{figo10}.

\headerbox{Materials and Methods}{name=methods,column=0,below=arc}{

Raw time-series data is collected from a triaxial accelerometer ($a_x, a_y, a_z$)
and a triaxial gyroscope ($g_x, g_y, g_z$). 
Then, a $N$ samples length time-series, e.g. $a_x$, is used to obtain the
time-delay embedded matrix, $E \{ a_x \}$, with $m=20$ and $\tau=6$ \cite{frank10, sama13}.
Finally, PCA is applied to  $E \{ a_x \}$ to compute the percentage of cumulative energy \cite{nhammerla11}.
The method is applied to six simple movements 
which were performed by six participants wearing an intertial sensor on their right wrist, 
each movement were continuously repeated for 20 seconds.
}

\headerbox{Conclusion and Outlook}{name=conclusion,column=0,below=methods}{
Measuring variability in human activity
offers an approach to understand user's performence over the course of training, 
practice or rehabilitation.
In the future, we will collect data from a wider range of individuals
(gender and age) and from additional sensors. Also, 
different classification techniques will be explored.

The values of percentage of cumulative energy (PCE) are presented for
triaxial accelerometer (ACC) and triaxial gyroscope (GYR) sensors 
accross partipants and their average denoted by ``avg''. 

It is apparent that circular and 8-shape movements show a constant 
trend between participants; however, such a trend is not evident for 
the other movements.
We assume that the evident variability for the static, horizontal, vertical and diagonal movements
is due to the flexibility in the experiment where participants
were only asked to perform the movements at a comfortable speed.
