Press Release
---


Your press release should consider what your research entails and why it may be important, who it addresses, how it’s coming about, among other such important points.
A press release should try to answer 6 key questions (note, not all may be
applicable for your research, but most will be):

# Who? Who’s involved in this research? Both internal and external groups and organisations

-School of Eletronic, Eletric and Computer Engineering
-the Mexican's National Council for Science and Technology (CONACyT)

# What? What is new? What about it is different?
current analysis of data 
using time domain or frequency domain analysis has been presented good results,
however, approaching analasys of data by using tools from nonlinear dynamics is 
of comtemporary research methods in Human Activity Recognition.

# Why? Why does this research matter?
By developing new approaches to analyse data 
this research has the potential to made contributions in many areas
such as clinical, video games, teraphy, sports.

# Where? Is there a geographical angle? Does the research apply do a distinct area or location?
General public.


# How? How did the research come about? Is the methodology notable?

The problem begun when we tried to dance with a robot, we therfore bugun to understand the complexity
of the problem and notice that the current methods for time domain analysis and frequency domain
were too poor to create a significiative application. We therefore started working with the time-delay embedding
or Takens thorem which is basically a transformation of the dimensionality of the data.
We are now in the fisrt of the three stages
analysis of the takens theorem, pca algorithm and the determination of the embedded dimension parameters
applications, collection of participants
First application is to measure the expertise of dancers to do this we are analysing
10 basics salsa foot patterns
in which we are implementing the TDE-PCA and we are obtaining quite good results
that can conduct our research to another applications in clinical or teraupic analysis of human body activity
