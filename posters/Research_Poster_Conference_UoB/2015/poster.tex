The use of data from wearable sensors to analyse Human-Activity Recognition 
(e.g. walking, running, cycling, rowing, etc.) has incresed during the 
last 20 years. Nonetheless, when it comes to studying dextrous performance, 
recognition of event activities might not be sufficient. 

Dexterity in human activity is seldom an exclusive matter of performing events faster
or sequencing the events in a more consistent and defined manner, but could involve 
performing the actions in a very different way when compared to novices. 
Theferefore, identifying how \textit{well} an action is performed 
is more challenging than simply identifying action type \cite{nhammerla11}.

This research will extend the field of HAR by applying concepts from Chaos Theory \cite{asama13}  
to create novel analysis and interpretation of the data which allows us to recognise dexterity.

Thirteen male participants with different years of experiences in dancing salsa were recruited,
one expert  (14 yr of experience), one intermediate  (4 yr of experience) and eleven novice dancers.

    \begin{multicols}{2}
	Each participant was shown a series of video clips (demonstrating salsa steps) 
	and were then asked to copy the steps in time to music during 20 seconds.

  The shape of the state space show a tighter and less variated pattern for the expert than 
  for the other dexterity levels. The intermediate participant is showing a consistent action
  but this is different than the expert, and the novice is showing a pattern which appear 
  disjointed and noisy.
