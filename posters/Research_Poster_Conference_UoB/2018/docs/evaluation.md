Preparing your presentation
---

You are expected to talk about your research for 5-6 minutes. 
Your presentation will not be timed, but the judges will have only 10-12 minutes 
to spend with each candidate so make sure you leave enough time for Q&A.
Please introduce yourself to the judges (your name, your department etc.) 
before you start your presentation. 
It is a good idea to refer back to your poster when talking about your research 
and use it as a visual aid. 
You do not need to prepare anything else for the presentation.

Judges may ask you questions about your research, 
so use the Q&A as an opportunity to network with them.
Please remember that the aim of the Conference is to give you an opportunity 
to explain your research and its significance to the judges 
(as well as to the other guests) in a clear and engaging way and give you 
an opportunity to practise your networking and public engagement skills.

We will have judges and guests from a variety of backgrounds 
(employers from the West Midlands, academics, other members of staff and researchers). 
This is a great opportunity for you to extend your research network, 
so make sure you make the most of this opportunity.
