## Research Poster Conference 2018
The Annual Research Poster Conference aims to give our postgraduate 
researchers at the University of Birmingham the opportunity to engage 
with both academic and non-academic audiences in ways that highlight 
the importance of their research in an accessible way. 
Posters will be judged by a panel that are from a wide variety of 
backgrounds including alumni, employers, University of Birminghamâ€™s 
cultural partners and academic staff. 
For this reason, your summary will be shortlisted on the basis of the following criteria:

a. Your summary should have an engaging title that attracts 
non-specialists' attention

b. Your summary should have a clear outline describing the 
originality and impact of your research

c. You should use jargon-free language where technical terms 
are explained clearly wherever possible

eMOTION: Analysis of Emotion and Movement Variability in the Context of Human-Robot Interaction


Short summary of your research (150 words maximum):


```
Movement variability is an inherent feature within and between persons.
Research on measurement and understanding of movement variability has been well
established in the previous three decades in areas such as biomechanics,
sport science, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience and robotics.
With that in mind, we hypothesise that the subtle variations of face emotions
and simple body movements can be both described and quantified in a similar 
fashion as with the methodologies of movement variability.
Such methodologies are based on nonlinear dynamics, particularly with the use of
the state space reconstruction theorem where dynamics of an unknown system
can be reconstructed using one dimensional time series.
For this work, we explain how the state space reconstruction theorem works and
present preliminary results of the use of the state reconstruction
to understand the relationship between the variability of arm movements, head
pose estimation and the emotion of six participants in the context of 
human-robot interactions.
The results of the state space reconstruction in the context of face emotions 
lead us to conclude that not only the variability of upper body movement 
can be analysed and quantified using the state space reconstruction theorem
but also the subtle variability of face emotion transitions across time 
(e.g. from excitement to neutral to boredom, etc)
can be understood and measured using nonlinear dynamics.
