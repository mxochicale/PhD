Hi,

Congratulations once again for being accepted to present at 
the Research Poster Conference 2018! 
This conference is a fantastic opportunity to share your research, 
learn about other research at the University and engage with the public.


This year, we are trying to emphasise public engagement and 
want to promote you and your work as much as possible. 
We will have a screen in the hall on the day of the event, 
which will rotate through each of your Title's 
so everyone's work will be on display. 
We would also like to have a photo of each of you to go on the slides, 
this could be your student ID picture, 
or you may choose to submit something else. 
Please adhere to the following criteria when selecting a photo:

Shows only your head and shoulders
Is in colour 
Is not blurry or pixelated
Is appropriate for an academic conference 
(i.e. something youâ€™d be happy to show an employer or your nan- whichever is scarier to you)

Please submit your photo by the end of the week (1st June) 
along with your Twitter username and poster title. 
If there are any problems, please let me know.

Best wishes,
Solin, on behalf of the Research Poster Conference team, 2018
