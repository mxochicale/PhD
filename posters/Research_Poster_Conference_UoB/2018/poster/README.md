# Preparing and submitting your poster
The poster conference is intended for a non-specialist audience. 
Please consider this when you are preparing your poster and your presentation. 
Your poster should be a visual presentation of your research. 
It should be understandable to the guests without verbal commentâ€“ someone 
might look at it when you are not there to explain.
