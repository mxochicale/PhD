## Applications for Research Poster Conference 2018 are now open.

This year the Research Poster Conference will take place on Wednesday 
13 June 2018 in the Great Hall of the Aston Webb building.

This one-day conference is a celebration of postgraduate research at 
the University of Birmingham. Postgraduate researchers from different 
disciplines come together in the Great Hall to present their research 
to fellow researchers, academics, a panel of judges and members of the 
public. The Conference is a great opportunity to gain experience in 
presenting your research to a non-specialist audience and 
networking with other researchers and academics from different disciplines.

## Eligibility

The Research Poster Conference is open to all postgraduate researchers 
who are currently registered at the University of Birmingham and 
are available to attend the conference.

## How to apply

Please submit your application for the Research Poster Conference 2018 
by completing the application form by Friday,  2 March 2018.  



##  Summary requirements
The conference audience will consist of researchers and academics from 
different departments within the University. Therefore, we are looking 
for text specifically aimed for a broad audience. Please note that if 
your summary is deemed incoherent or too technical, you may be contacted

non-specialists' attention
2. Your summary should have a clear outline describing the

you will be asked to submit your research poster.

You will receive further instructions about producing and presenting 
your poster and we will be providing training sessions such as 
'Designing Effective Posters', 'Networking Skills' and 
'Public Engagement' to prepare you for the Research Poster Conference. 

## Prizes
There will be many prizes available including, but not limited to: 
overall winner, best poster design, best poster presentation,

partners and academic staff. In order to win a prize, you must attend 
the Research Poster Conference. 

The University Graduate School is happy to announce that our prize
