## eMOTION: Analysis of Emotion and Movement Variability in the Context of Human-Robot Interaction

Miguel P Xochicale

### Abstract 

Movement variability (MV) is an inherent feature within and between persons.
Such MV can be seen in many activities where human body movement is involved. 
So, we hypothesise that not only the subtle 
variations of face expressions but also simple body movements 
in the context of human-robot interaction activities
can be described and quantified 
using nonlinear dynamics (ND) theorems.

We therefore explain how the uniform time-delay embedding theorem, a technique of ND, works 
and present both results of our hypothesis and its potential impact 
in areas such as 
rehabilitation, neuroscience or artificial intelligence to name a few.

## Research Poster Conference 2018

This year the Research Poster Conference will take place on Wednesday 
13 June 2018 in the Great Hall of the Aston Webb building.

This one-day conference is a celebration of postgraduate research at 
the University of Birmingham. Postgraduate researchers from different 
disciplines come together in the Great Hall to present their research 
to fellow researchers, academics, a panel of judges and members of the 
public. The Conference is a great opportunity to gain experience in 
presenting your research to a non-specialist audience and 
networking with other researchers and academics from different disciplines.

## Eligibility

The Research Poster Conference is open to all postgraduate researchers 
who are currently registered at the University of Birmingham and 
are available to attend the conference.

## How to apply

Please submit your application for the Research Poster Conference 2018 
by completing the application form by Friday,  2 March 2018.  



##  Summary requirements
The conference audience will consist of researchers and academics from 
different departments within the University. Therefore, we are looking 
for text specifically aimed for a broad audience. Please note that if 
your summary is deemed incoherent or too technical, you may be contacted 
by the conference team and asked to make amendments.

Your summary will be shortlisted on the basis of the following criteria:

1. Your summary should have an engaging title that attracts 
non-specialists' attention
2. Your summary should have a clear outline describing the 
originality and impact of your research
3. You should use jargon-free language where technical terms are 
explained clearly wherever possible

## What happens next
If your summary is accepted for the Research Poster Conference, 
you will receive an email within two weeks after the deadline and 
you will be asked to submit your research poster.

You will receive further instructions about producing and presenting 
your poster and we will be providing training sessions such as 
'Designing Effective Posters', 'Networking Skills' and 
'Public Engagement' to prepare you for the Research Poster Conference. 

## Prizes
There will be many prizes available including, but not limited to: 
overall winner, best poster design, best poster presentation, 
best posters from individual colleges and many more. Posters will 
be judged by a panel that are from a wide variety of backgrounds 
including alumni, employers, University of Birmingham’s cultural 
partners and academic staff. In order to win a prize, you must attend 
the Research Poster Conference. 

The University Graduate School is happy to announce that our prize 
for the Overall winner will be £1000 to be spent on research. 
Other prizes will be confirmed closer to the date of the Conference.
