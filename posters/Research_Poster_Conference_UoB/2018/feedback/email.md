Dear Miguel,
Please find attached my comments. I hope you find them useful. 
Your research is clearly very interesting, so you only need to think 
about how you can communicate this to a non-specialist audience. 
Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my comments 
and good luck with the 3MT competition.

Best wishes,
Eren

Dear Eren

Thanks for your kind reply. In terms of feedback, 
I would rather have written feedback than one-to-one feedback which, 
I believe, the former help me substantially in improving 
my written research skills.

Thanks for the invitation for the Three-Minute Thesis competition. 
Actually I have already submitted my abstract 
(and practicing and preparing for it), hopefully my submission will be accepted. 

Regards
Miguel

Dear Miguel,

Thank you for your email. This year we received 170 applications and the capacity of the Great Hall is 110 posters, 
so we can only accommodate 110 researchers.

The abstracts were judged on the basis of the following criteria:

1. Your abstract should have an engaging title that attracts non-specialists' attention 
2. Your abstract should have a clear outline describing the originality and impact of your research 
3. Your abstract should use jargon-free language where technical terms are explained clearly wherever possible

I am happy to meet to give you feedback on your abstract, but I am away until 5 April, 
so please let me know if you would like to meet on 5 April.

Since this is your last year, I suggest you consider participating in the Three-Minute Thesis competition, 
as the 3MT will give you a better opportunity to promote your research to future employers.

Best wishes,
Eren
