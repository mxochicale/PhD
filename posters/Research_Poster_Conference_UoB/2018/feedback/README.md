eMOTION: Analysis of Emotion and Movement Variability in the Context of Human-Robot Interaction

> The first part of your title works well, but think about an alternative way to clarify 
‘movement variability’ for a non-specialist audience. 
I can understand that this might be an understandable term in your field, 
but it would not be to someone in Arts/Humanities.

```
Research on measurement and understanding of movement
variability has been well
established in the previous three decades in areas such as
biomechanics,
sport science, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience and
robotics.
```

> You highlight the fact that ‘movement variability’ is an 
important concept in sciences, but do not explain what it means. 
It would be good to clarify this in your first sentence, 
so you can grab the attention of your readers (or audience in the 3MT competition). 
Try to think about concrete, everyday examples to help people from other 
fields understand the concept.

emotions
and simple body movements can be both described and quantified
in a similar
fashion as with the methodologies of movement variability

> What are these methodologies? 
Why is it important to describe /quantify face emotions and body movements? 
Your research is clearly very interesting, 
but you will need to simplify and explain these terms clearly to your audience. 
I know it is difficult to do this when you are in your last year, 
as we start taking concepts related to our research for granted, 
but it is important to find a way to explain them to someone with no background info. 
How would you explain your research to your nan or a 5-year old?

Such methodologies are based on nonlinear dynamics, particularly
with the use of
the state space reconstruction theorem where dynamics of an
unknown system
can be reconstructed using one dimensional time series.
For this work, we explain how the state space reconstruction

 works and
present preliminary results of the use of the state reconstruction
to understand the relationship between the variability of arm
movements, head
pose estimation and the emotion of six participants in the context of
human-robot interactions.
The results of the state space reconstruction in the context of face
emotions
lead us to conclude that not only the variability of upper body
movement
can be analysed and quantified using the state space reconstruction
theorem
but also the subtle variability of face emotion transitions across time
(e.g. from excitement to neutral to boredom, etc

> You might also want to re-think the structure of your abstract. 
Your audience (or your readers) will want to follow a story
set the scene /background for them, 
tell them  
* what your research focus is, 
* how it is original, 
* what makes it important (highlight this)..
* then tell them how you do it (methods) and 
* then the outcome using examples that people can relate to is also useful to grab the attention of your audience
