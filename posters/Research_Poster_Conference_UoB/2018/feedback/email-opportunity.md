Dear Miguel,
I hope you are well. I am contacting you about the Research Poster Conference. 
I am aware that you had submitted your abstract to take part and although 
your abstract was good, we did not have enough space to accommodate it in the conference. 
One of the presenters will not be able to join us because of family emergency, 
so I would like to give you the opportunity to join us as a presenter on 13 June. 
I think you have made significant improvement in the 3MT and since this is your last year, 
it might be a good chance to present at the conference. 
If you are happy to join us, could you please email me the following by Tuesday (22 May):
 
1. Updated title and abstract 
(Max 150 words, taking into consideration my feedback on the original abstract)
 
If you have any questions, please let me know.
 
Best wishes,
Eren
