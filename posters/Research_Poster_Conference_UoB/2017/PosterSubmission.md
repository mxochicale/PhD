Poster Submission
---


Dear Participant,

We hope your poster design is going well. 

Please remember that the deadline to submit your poster is Friday 26 May 2017. 
Your poster should be emailed to the University Graduate School
<graduateschool@contacts.bham.ac.uk> with the subject line: ‘Poster Submission’. 


 Your posters will be judged by two non-specialist judges on the day of the conference, using the following criteria:
 
 
Poster
 Did the poster describe the research in a clear way; was it accessible to a non-specialist?
 Was the research conveyed in a creative way?
 The overall appearance
 Did the poster have a logical format?
 
Presentation
 Did the presenter address why their research was important?
 Clarity of presentation
 Engagement with research
 Ability to engage with judges’ questions
 
 
 When preparing your poster and presentation, please try to abide by the above criteria. 
 Ideally, you should avoid jargon and technical language wherever possible, and ensure that 
 your poster engages a non-specialised audience containing a balance of text and images 
 (or graphics).
 
 To help you with your poster design and presentation, we have created a series of ‘Top Tip’
 Videos from last year’s winners which can be accessed below:
