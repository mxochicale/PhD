 Research Poster Conference 2017
 =======================


## Applications for Research Poster Conference now open

This year the Research Poster Conference will take place on Thursday 15 June 2017
in the Great Hall of the Aston Webb building.

This one-day conference is a celebration of postgraduate research at the
University of Birmingham. Postgraduate researchers from different disciplines come
together in the Great Hall to present their research to fellow researchers,
academics, a panel of judges and members of the public. The Conference is a
great opportunity to gain experience in presenting your research to a
non-specialist audience and networking with other researchers and academics
from different disciplines.

## Eligibility

The Research Poster Conference is open to all postgraduate researchers
who are currently registered at the University of Birmingham and are available
to attend the conference.


## How to apply

The Research Poster Conference application consists of two stages:

* Stage 1: Complete the application form by Monday, 3 April 2017.
  (Abstract Deadline Extended to 10th of April 2017) [ADD IMAGE LINK]

* Stage 2: Submitting your research poster after your application is accepted.



In the application form you will be asked to provide a summary of your
research and a provisional title for your poster.  



## Summary requirements

The conference audience will consist of researchers and academics from different
departments within the University. Therefore, we are looking for text specifically
aimed for a broad audience. Please note that if your summary is deemed incoherent
or too technical, you may be contacted by the conference team and asked to make
amendments.

Your summary will be short listed on the basis of the following criteria:   
1. Your summary should have an engaging title that attracts non-specialists' attention   
2. Your summary should have a clear outline describing the originality and impact of
your research    
3. You should use jargon-free language where technical terms are explained
clearly wherever possible



## What happens next

If your summary is accepted for the Research Poster Conference, you will receive
an email within two weeks after the deadline and you will be asked to submit
your research poster.  

You will receive further instructions about producing and presenting your poster
and we will be providing training sessions such as 'Designing Effective Posters',
'Networking Skills' and 'Public Engagement' to prepare you for the Research
Poster Conference.   


## Prizes

There will be many prizes available including, but not limited to: overall winner,
best poster design, best poster presentation, best posters from individual colleges
and many more. Posters will be judged by a panel that are from a wide variety of
backgrounds including alumni, employers, University of Birmingham’s cultural partners
and academic staff. In order to win a prize, you must attend the Research Poster Conference.

The University Graduate School is happy to announce that our prize for the Overall
