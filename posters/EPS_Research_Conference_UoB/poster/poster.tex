\headerbox{Introduction}{name=problem,span=2,column=0,row=0}{

Movement Variability is an inherent characteristic of human movement \cite{newell93}.
Generally, humans perform the same action slightly differently trial by trial
which is a common challenge in Human Activity Recogtion (HAR).
However, little research has been done in order to automatically measure such movement variability in HAR \cite{bulling2014}.
For the current work, I am focusing on the extraction of simple features in time-domain, frequency domain and nonlinear dymanics domain
in order to provide insight into the movement variability across persons and inter-trial variability in dance activities.

\headerbox{Human Activity Recognition Chain}{name=arc,span=2,column=0,below=problem}{

Bulling \emph{et al.} \cite{bulling2014} reviewed the state-of-the-art of
HAR to identify activities from body-worn intertial sensors.

\headerbox{Materials and Methods}{name=methods,span=2,column=0,below=arc}{

Raw data is collected from a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope ($a_x, a_y, a_z, g_x, g_y, g_z$).
Then, a $N$ samples length time-series, e.g. $a_x$, is used to obtain
\textit{(i)} mean and standard deviation;
\textit{(ii)} frequency DC component and Power Spectrum Energy and;
\textit{(iii)} the time-delay embedded matrix, $E \{ a_x \}$, with $m=20$ and $\tau=3$ \cite{frank10, sama13},
to which PCA is applied to  $E \{ a_x \}$ to compute the percentage cumulative energy (PCE) \cite{nhammerla11}.

\headerbox{Conclusion and Outlook}{name=conclusion,span=2,column=0,below=methods}{

Although the time-delay embedding technique is subject to different $m$ and $\tau$ values
which are related to the length and complexity of the time-series,
the reconstructed state spaces are giving us insights into movement variability for simple dance steps
of thirteen novice dancers.

We showed that the use of time-domain, frequency domain and nonlinear dymanics are giving us
insight into the movement variability across participants.

From this, there are three areas that we are going to investigate:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Collect data from a wider range of individuals (gender and age) and from additional sensors,
 \item Undertake a wider review of nonlinear techniques that can be used for the assessment of variability using wearable sensors, and
 \item Explore the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for automatic recognition of the movement variability.
\end{itemize}

\headerbox{Results}{name=results,span=1,column=2,row=0,aligned=problem}{
Simple salsa mambo step and side cross-over step were danced by thirteen participans.
Reconstructed State Spaces (RSS) are shown for  all the novice participants
dancing both steps.
Similarly, error bars are presented for mean, standard deviadtion (SD), DC frequency (fDC),
power spectral density (fPSD) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the
PCE using the triaxial accelerometer ($a_x, a_y, a_z$) and triaxial gyroscope ($g_x, g_y, g_z$)
for both steps.
