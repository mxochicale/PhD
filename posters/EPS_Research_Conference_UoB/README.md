# College of Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Conference (internal event)


The 2016 College of Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Conference celebrates the breadth of College research excellence, and identifies and addresses some of the grand challenges colleagues face in their day-to-day work. It seeks to highlight the interdisciplinary strengths of groups and individuals across the disciplines. Representatives from each of the Schools will shine a spotlight on the research priorities and leading projects to raise awareness of internal expertise.

Location: Bramall Music Building  
Category: Engineering and Physical Sciences, Research  
Dates: Tuesday 25th October 2016 (09:20-17:00)  


This conference is open to academics, research students and professional services staff from the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences only.



# Poster Competition

PhD and Post-Doctoral Researchers (PDRAs) from across the College are encouraged to submit posters for the conference competition. These will be displayed throughout the day in the Great Hall and two Â£500 prizes will be awarded, one for the best PhD student poster and one for the best PDRA poster. The deadline for submissions is Friday 21 October 2016.

Finished and printed posters should be delivered to Sukhi Birks in Poynthing Physics (R13 on the map) along with the following form by 15:00 on Friday 21 October. Suhki's office is P14 and is located on the ground floor. Posters should be A1 and portrait.
