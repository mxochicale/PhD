**RULE1** 
Write the conclussions to your paper. Even a large paper or thesis chaper will 
not have more than five or six substantial conclussions.
Each conclusion must be succinct, and occupy one sentence and less than two lines.
The conclusionss as written here will not enter into the final work so they do not
need modifiers such as "however" and "that is".

**RULE2**
Write only the results necessary to make the conclussions you presented.

**RULE3**
Write only the methods neccesary to understand how these results were obtained.

**RULE4**
Write the discussions, which should present only additional information (e.g. literature)
that modifies, extends, confirms, or contradicts the conclussions based on your
results.

**RULE5**
Write the introduction, which will have only the minimum information necessary to present 
questions to which the conclusions are the answers.

WHEN YOU HAVE THIS, THE STORY IS TOLD.
