These are some of the take away messages from the presentation:

* Advancing knowledge of humankind? or having fun for yourself?


* Default action of a paper submission is rejection. MASTERPIECE, or it will not sell.

* Marco Polo went, saw, and told the world

* How clever your ideas are doesn't depend on you, but 
how perfect your writing and formatting are, does!

* Does your paper look and read clean?

* Two ideas, two papers

* If you can't formulate the message of the paper in its title, re-think it

* Lack of understanding breaks communication

* Actively prevent misunderstanding 
"Our approach is not a modification of SVM"

* Give sufficient details for complete and clear understanding 

* Can the reader reproduce your experiments?

* Can YOU reproduce them in a month?

* It is your job to make it easy to understand 

* Anchor new things in known things -- progress must be incremental

* Specify what the novelty and importance is 

* Specify why your method is better

* When I want readers to understand me, I use fewer words/letters 

* Good papers: --solid, -- easy to follow, -- good state of the art overview, --detailed reportof experiments

* WHERE TO SEND:
- look at other papers in this specific journal:
how they look, how they reason, how important things communicate.

* goal of science is understanding, not solving tasks

* --Read abstracts of 100, --Read intro + conclusion of 50, --Read and understand 15

* Give a definitive answer to a (small) research question?
