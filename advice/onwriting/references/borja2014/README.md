**STEP1** Prepare the figures and tables

- Avoid crowded plots
- Appropriate axis label size.
- Include clear symbols and data sets that are easy to distinguish


**STEP2** Write the methods
Pay attention to the lenght of the manuscript which for elsevier is generally from 
25 to 40 pages, double spaced.

Title: Short and informative
Abstract: 1 paragraph (<250 words)
Introduction: 1.5-2 pages
Methods: 2-3 pages
Results: 6-8 pages
Discussion: 4-6 pages
Conclusion: 1 paragraph
Figures: 6-8 (one per page)
Tables: 1-3 (one per page)
Reference: 20-50 papers (2-4 pages)

**STEP3** Write up the Results
This section responds to the question "What have you found?"
--An importan issue is that you must not include reference in this section;
you are presenting your results, so you cannot refer to others here. If you refer 
to others, is becuase you are disscussing your results, and this must be included in 
the Discussion section.


**STEP4** Write the Discussion
--Here you must respont to what the results mean.
--Here you have a chance to sell your data.
--Take into account that a huge number of manuscripts are rejected becuase 
the Discussion is weak.
--Never ignore work in disagreement with yours,
in turn, you must confront it and convince the reader that you are correct or better.


**STEP5** Write a clear conclusion
-- This section shows how the work advances the field from the present state of
knowledge. 

**STEP6** Write a compelling introduction
A good introduction should answer the following questions:
-What is the problem to be solved?
-Are there any existing solutions?
-Which is the best?
-What is its main limitation?
-What do you hope to achieve?

--Editors hate improper citations of too many references irrelevant to the work,
or innapropriate judgments on your own achievements.

--Here are some additional tips for the introduction:
-Never use more words than necesssary (be consise and to-the-point).
-The introduction must be organised from the global to the particular point of view,
guiding the readers to your objective when writing this paper.
-State the purpose of the paper and research strategy adopted to answer the question.

**STEP7** Write the Abstract
-Together with the title, it is the advertisement of your article. Make it interesting
and easy to understood without reading the whole article. Avoid using jargon, uncommon
abbreviations and  references.
-In an abstract, the two whats that are essential are:
What has been done?
What are teh main findings?

**STEP8** Compose a consise and descriptive title
--It is your first (and probably only) opportunity to attract the reader's attention.
--Long title distracts readers. Remove all redudancies. Be precise
-- Titles should be specific. Think about "how will I search for this piece of information"
when you design the title.

**STEP9** Select keywords for indexing

**STEP10** Write the Acknowledgments


**STEP11** Write up the references
