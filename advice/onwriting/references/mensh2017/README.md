**RULE2. Write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know your work**
-- Think like a designer--for each element, determine the impact that you want 
to have on people and then strive to achieve that object.

**RULE3. Stick to the context-content-conclusion scheme**
--The vast majority of popular (i.e., memorable and re-tallable) stories have a 
structure with a discernible beginning, a well-defined body, and an end. 
The beginning sets up the context for the story, while the body (content) advances 
the story towards an ending in which the problems fin their conclusions.

**RULE4. Optmise your logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism**
--Only the central idea of the paper should be touched upon multiple times. 
Otherwise, each subject should be covered in only one place in order to minimise 
the number of subject changes.
--Parallelism makes it easier to read the text because the rease is familiar with 
the structure. There is nothing wrong with using the same word multiple times in a 
sentence or paragraph.

**RULE5. Tell a complete story in the abstract**
**RULE6. Communuicate why the paper matters in the introduction**
**RULE7. Deliver the results as a sequence of statements, supported by figures,
that connect logically to support the central cotribution**
**RULE8. Discuss how teh gab was filled, the limitations of the interpretation, 
and the revelance to the field**

**RULE9. Allocate time where it matters: Tittle, abstract, figures, and outlining**
--The time that we do spend on each section can be used efficiently by planning text 
before producing it. Make an outline. We like to write one informal sentence for 
each planned paragraph.
--Because the story has an overall arc, each paragraph should have a defined role 
in advancing this story.


**RULE10. Get feedback to reduce, reuse, and recyle the story**
--Sucessfully writing a paper typically requires input from multiple people.
Test readers are necessary to make sure that the overall story works. They can also 
give valuable input on where the sotyr appears tp move too quickly or too slowly. 
They can clarify when it is best to go back to the drawing board and retell the 
entire story.
