These are some hightlight of Lipton Z C 2018 [1] advice for writing a scientific paper
in machine learning. It might be a good idea to create a checklist when 
wrting your papers and go trhought all the poitns suggested here.

I like three things about this advice, 

* the use of short sentences, 
specially I do like this quoite "**Great scientific writers write mostly in short sentences.**"
* quickly arrive at the paper construction and don;t bore the reviewer.
* a good caption should be between 1 and 3 lines
 

# INTRODUCTION 

## Keep your abstract short

Think of the abstract as the 2-minute spotlight talk advertising your paper. 
The points should feel like bullets.

* Contextualize the problem in either one sentence or one phrase
* Identify what’s wrong with existing approaches
* Go big: clearly state your major contribution (can also lead with this).
* Two or three sentences to sell the details, major quantitative result, etc.


## DELETE GENERIC OPENINGS

“Deep learning has had many successes at many things”. 
If the first sentence for your paper can be pre-pended to any paper in all of ML/big data, delete it.  
First impressions matter. 
The first sentence is the most precious real estate in your introduction. Don’t squander it.


# Organisation

One immediate tell that you are engaging with a lousy writer is 
that the paper doesn’t look right, before you read a single word. 
Sections, like bullets on slides should be balanced. 


## A READER SHOULD UNDERSTAND YOUR PAPER JUST FROM LOOKING AT THE FIGURES, OR WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE FIGURES

A blind reader should understand precisely what you do, even if they miss a couple granular bits of data captured in figures. 

The figures should tell a coherent story. If your reader skips to the figures **(reviewers will)**, 
they should be able to see roughly what’s going on and understand the significance of the findings. 

But don’t go overboard. Captions should not be giant paragraphs. A good caption should be between 1 and 3 lines.

##  QUICKLY ARRIVE AT THE PAPER’S CONTRIBUTION

knowing your audience and positioning intelligently. 
Most of your abstract (by sentences), your intro (by paragraphs), 
and your paper (by pages) should articulate what you do.

##  ANTICIPATE THE READER’S QUESTIONS AND ANSWER THEM IN THE PAPER
 If you can anticipate the question and know the answer, write it. 
If you do not know the answer, then run an experiment to find out. 
I hope this point hits home that doing strong research and writing clearly are tightly linked. 


# Language 

## BREAK UP LONG SENTENCES
Young writers often believe, mistakenly, that long sentences reflect language skills. 
**Great scientific writers write mostly in short sentences.**

## JETTISON INTENSIFIERS AND VACUOUS ADVERBS
Examples: Extremely, Very, Incredibly, Completely, Barely, Essentially, Rather, Quite, Definitely, …




## SUBJECTS, VERBS AND MODIFIERS, SHOULD ALL AGREE

One common mistake in writing is to attribute verbs and modifiers 
to the wrong subjects, e.g. the algorithm tries to X, or the data is biased. 
Algorithms don’t try, just as they don’t think. 

Corollary: every action should be attributed.  
Verbs with no subject can often emerge in passive constructions (where the main verb is “to be”). 
For example, “LSTMs are claimed to X, Y, Z”. 
Who is doing the claiming? This information better appear somewhere. 
One solution would be to append a parenthetical citation. 
A better solution might be clearly put the claims in the mouths of their authors.


# Bibliography

## CITE GENEROUSLY

The papers you ought to cite are likely written by the people who will  
be reviewing your paper. One common lame review will consist of an anonymous 
reviewer asking why you didn’t cite works A, B, and C (all by the same author). 
If the works are not relevant, then do not cite. 
If they are relevant, you have nothing to lose and much to gain by citing.

Among the good karma you’ll earn: (1) you are less likely to get a shirty review, 
and (2) these are often people you want to  
work with later and they may notice the citation and read your paper.

## CITE THROUGHOUT

Reviewers are lazy, and do not have photographic memories. 
If your work builds on others’ contributions, 
do not confine your citations to the related work section – 
that’s just to summarize your work’s context in the literature. 
Cite throughout the text whenever you invoke methods that precede your own. 


## EXHAUST THE REFERENCES LIMIT

This is a pragmatic positioning point and applies to conference publications 
that limit the number of pages for references (often 1 or 2). 
If you omit the most related work, reviewers will nail you no matter what. 
But if you omit some borderline related work and they call you on it, 
having no room left in the references section is a good excuse
