Spoilet: The guide is biased towards communication -author's discipline-
but it is applicable to other disciplines.



*  http://www.journalreviewer.org/ let you get a sense for how quickly you can expect your manuscript to go through peer review.
However, it is tageted for displines other than engineering
* Re-formatting articles for different journals can easily eat up your free time! 



# Selecting a Journal


The first step is to figure our what might be the best journal to publish in. 
The journal you select dictates how you write the article. 
 It will save you time if you decide on a journal before you even start writing!

 Once you start to find journals, keep track of them. 
An easy way to accomplish this is by maintaining a spreadsheet. 
Mine is a simple Google spreadsheet with columns for title, category 
(e.g. communication, political science, STS), impact factor, ranking, open-access (yes/no), 
and comments.

How should you evaluate a journal? 
There is no easy answer because there are many factors. 
Impact factor and ranking are the most obvious. 
Impact factor is a statistic: 
the frequency each article in a journal has been cited each year.


When I was just starting out in academia my friend danah boyd stressed 
the importance of publishing in journals that have a rapid turnaround time.

# Preparing and Submitting the Manuscript

Once you have found a suitable journal, start writing the article using their formatting requirements. 
Re-formatting articles for different journals can easily eat up your free time! 

There are several things to remember at the moment you want to submit your article. 
You want to click submit, but wait! Do one last editing pass for grammar and spelling. 
Double-check formatting requirements, and inclusion of graphics. 
Some journals request tables and figures in separate documents, while 
others are fine with them being in the body of the main document.


 editors are grateful when you save them time 
by suggesting potential reviewers in sometimes arcane topic areas.


# There are four types of reviews you might receive:
* Desk reject: an editor may simply say an article is not suitable for their journal.
* Accept: a straight acceptance without revisions is extremely rare. 
In ten years of publishing over fifteen articles I have never received one. 
* Reject: in this case the manuscript was sent out for peer review, 
and reviewers deemed it not suitable for publication. 
This does not mean that this was a fruitless endeavor, 
since you can read the reviewers comments. What it does mean is there are sufficient 
issues with the manuscript that the reviewers can’t identify a clear path for revision. 
However, they should justify the issues they see, which can be helpful feedback for publication. 
Be sure to thank the editor and reviewers for their time, even if you don’t agree with their decision.
* Revise & resubmit: many submissions will receive an “R&R.” 
This means the reviewers have suggested changes they believe 
will bring a manuscript up to the level where it would be suitable for publishing. 
Often an R&R will be two reviewers suggesting revisions. 




# How to Handle the R&R

* A good editor will provide some guidance on the path to acceptance. 
It can be difficult to read unvarnished comments about an article you’ve put so much time into. 
It is sometimes difficult not to take feedback personally, 
but just remember that reviewers will evaluate your work on factors that you may not have considered.


# Finalizing and Publicizing the Article
As you move through the review process you will eventually 
get to the point the reviewers indicate they are fine with the draft. 
In rare cases they may recommend reject after a few rounds of revision. 
Once accepted, the editor may have a few final suggestions. 
At this point your article will move into the editing stage, 
when a different editor makes grammatical and spelling changes 
to help your article shine. Then you’ll review a 
“proof” — a PDF of exactly what your article will look like. 
You’re probably tired of this article by now, but read carefully! 
Line editors may have made changes that alter the argument you’re making.
