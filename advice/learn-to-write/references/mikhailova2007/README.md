Mikhailova, Elena A.; Nilson, Linda B.
Journal of Faculty Development, v21 n2 p93-100 May 2007
Faculty and graduate students are under enormous pressure to produce journal articles, yet little help is available on speeding up the process. This article offers an organizational strategy, called the "fast article writing methodology," for expediting article writing where the published product follows a standardized format. We also present faculty and graduate student assessments of it, obtained anonymously at the end of five workshop offerings on the topic. The lead author developed this methodology and conducted the workshop. All the participants immediately appreciated the value of the methodology and intended to implement it; a few intended to teach it to their students. (Contains 3 tables.)i
