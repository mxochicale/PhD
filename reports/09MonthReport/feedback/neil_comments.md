Dear Miguel

Here are some comments I've made on (what I hope) is the most recent version you sent me. 

I'm away from next week but will be back mid August.

Overall this is good, but I think you need to quickly make a decision as to whether your phd is:

Exploring human-readable feature representations of complex human activities to assist humans in judging the quality of an activity's essence... i.e. without all the baggage which comes from looking at (perish the thought) real humans.… i.e. "perceptible variability"
And/or 
Features which can be used for automatic detection in real time
Or 
Features for automatic detection that can beat the state of art.
Or 
Non-linear variability in general.

Personally, I think that the first has more scope or else you will be up against HAR researchers who are outperforming you simply by using a deep neural network...

But please talk to Chris and get his view on the above before proceeding.

Good luck

Neil. 


================================================
* you have not stated WHY you are interested in time delay embedding....versus the other methods..

* You pick Takens theorem and assume this is a Chaotic activity without a proper justification or motivation i.e. real time encodes of features. If you are considering time delay embedding as a feature extraction method, then you need to consider what you would compare it to i.e. the state of art as described by Bulling.

* earlier in this report you should underscore why dance is chaotic..




...............
CORRECTED POINTS
* a lot of the challenges are NOT different to speech  class variability (speaker variability) and null classes (silence!) or computer vision....these are common problems for all recognition tasks.


in the light of limitations of time-delay embedding
and PCA, which other non-linear analysis tools
would be suitable to explore the variability in 
human activities and use them as a features for machine
learning algorithms?

*worth stating to recognise human activity here...



* To improve it, you need to better explain what notion of variability you are trying to model. I think you are attempting to devise a method for capturing variability which reflects the quality of a dance as it would be perceived by humans expert judges. What about a visual representation that human judges could use to assist them in judging dance?
