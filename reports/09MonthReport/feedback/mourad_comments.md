Hi Miguel

Sorry for late delay in reading my emails while abroad.. Hope you can manage to produce something for this weekend.. Here are some comments:
1. The report is much improved as with respect to previous version
2. In the introduction section, you could expand briefly on the main issues related to prior and current research of dance movement recognition such that to highlight the difficulty of the task and the key challenges..  Better name few key challenges - related for instance to best choice of features, recognition algorithms, machine learning algorithms, evaluations, etc..
3. You should state explicitly in the introduction that you are trying to use motion sensors and any other types of sensors that you intend to use, ... in order to recognize dance activity.. and the fact that you may want to explore certain types of dances, if any
4. I would suggest to add as part of research questions for instance: What is the best set of features that can yield the best recognition rate of particular type of dance? How does the sensor positioning influence the outcomes? How can the expertise of the dancer be employed as a tool to empower the design strategy? How will the uncertainty pervading the sensors outcomes (stochastic) be combined with (subjective) uncertainty of dancer's movement? How can the training samples be chosen? How will the evaluation process be carried out?

5. Prior to Section 2 where u highlight the time delay embedding system, you could show a generic diagram of input-output of the system, highlighting for instance, the fact that you are interested in capturing the time-series data generated by the sensors.. and the fact you wanted to focus on the time-delay embedding system.. Possibly providing others hints and references for alternative techniques that you may want to explore in future as well..

6. It would be better to expand bit on the commenting of the resulting graphs in Sections 3 and 5, especially detailing any limitations that will be subject to future work or so..



Hope this helps..
