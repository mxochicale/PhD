Dear Miguel

The analysis is looking very interesting. I'll read this and provide some further comment but my immediate points are:

1. You must begin your report with the Research Questions for the PhD.  This should be section 1 and the rest of the report would explain these.

2.  The report is written more like a paper addressing a specific theme than a report of work completed.  
You need to include / mention the construction of the IMUs and the data collection / analysis you've already completed.  
My suggestion would be a section called 'Initial Data Collection and Analysis' - you mention the novice dancers data, but you could include the method, results and conclusions from the ISWC paper in this report - it shows how you've gone about collecting data and how you intend to analyse it.  Just because the ISWC reviewers didn't like it, doesnâ€™t mean you shouldn't include it as evidence of research in this report.

3.  The paragraph under 'Conclusion and Future Work' (about the ISWC paper) should go into the Publication Plan part.  You could also mention that there is a plan to revise the ISWC paper for another conference.

4. Under Future Work you should include a timeplan showing what you will be doing over the next 12 months (like the one on your wall).

These are all parts that the Reviewers will be expecting to see, in addition to the detailed technical content.

Best wishes

Dear Miguel

This is developing well. There are some typographical errors but these are easier for me to mark up on a printed version and I will do that on Tuesday.  The description of time delay embedding is clear, I think. What you don't have is any discussion of techniques for HAR, in terms of signal processing (from Fourier to Gaussian Mixture to Hidden Markov) as these represent the baseline of the event-based approach which fails to catch variability. This is important because much of the existing HAR literature uses these techniques so you need to cover this. Also, Martin Russell is keen on HMM.

It would be good to present a worked example of your analysis in the report - from artificial data to a simple, repetitive activity before going on to dancing.

Hope this helps...but you need to show the breadth of the topic before you show the depth of your approach and analysis.

Best wishes
Chris
