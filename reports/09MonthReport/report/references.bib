@article{Lara2013,
abstract = {Providing accurate and opportune information on people's activities and behaviors is one of the most important tasks in pervasive computing. Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios. Despite human activity recognition (HAR) being an active field for more than a decade, there are still key aspects that, if addressed, would constitute a significant turn in the way people interact with mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research.},

@art{Cleland2013,
abstract = {This article describes an investigation to determine the optimal placement of accelerometers for the purpose of detecting a range of everyday activities. The paper investigates the effect of combining data from accelerometers placed at various bodily locations on the accuracy of activity detection. Eight healthy males participated within the study. Data were collected from six wireless tri-axial accelerometers placed at the chest, wrist, lower back, hip, thigh and foot. Activities included walking, running on a motorized treadmill, sitting, lying, standing and walking up and down stairs. The Support Vector Machine provided the most accurate detection of activities of all the machine learning algorithms investigated. Although data from all locations provided similar levels of accuracy, the hip was the best single location to record data for activity detection using a Support Vector Machine, providing small but significantly better accuracy than the other investigated locations. Increasing the number of sensing locations from one to two or more statistically increased the accuracy of classification. There was no significant difference in accuracy when using two or more sensors. It was noted, however, that the difference in activity detection using single or multiple accelerometers may be more pronounced when trying to detect finer grain activities. Future work shall therefore investigate the effects of accelerometer placement on a larger range of these activities.},

abstract = {Research on activity recognition has traditionally focused on discriminating between different activities, i.e. to predict which activity was performed at a specific point in time. The quality of executing an activity, the how (well), has only received little attention so far, even though it potentially provides useful information for a large variety of applications. In this work we define quality of execution and investigate three aspects that pertain to qualitative activity recognition: specifying correct execution, detecting execution mistakes, providing feedback on the to the user. We illustrate our approach on the example problem of qualitatively assessing and providing feedback on weight lifting exercises. In two user studies we try out a sensor- and a model-based approach to qualitative activity recognition. Our results underline the potential of model-based assessment and the positive impact of real-time user feedback on the quality of execution.},

We propose a novel approach based on a combination of feature extraction using time-delay embedding and supervised learning. The computational requirements are considerably lower than existing approaches, so the processing can be done in real time on a low-powered portable device such as a mobile phone. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on a large, noisy data set comprising over 50 hours of data from six different subjects, including activities such as running and walking up or down stairs. We also demonstrate the ability of the system to accurately classify an individual from a set of 25 people, based only on the characteristics of their walking gait. The system requires very little parameter tuning, and can be trained with small amounts of data.},

@article{Caballero2014,
abstract = {In recent years, several works have explored variability using different approaches, trying to describe the variations in motor movement. Traditionally, movement variability was regarded as a system error due to noise of neuromuscular mechanisms, but alternative theories suggest that motor variability seems to reflect a functional behaviour improving motor control and enhancing learning. Controversial results have been reported about variability characteristics and its role in motor control and learning, and several works suggest that the main difficulty lies in how to measure this variability. In this work, we have outlined the most used non-linear tools to assess human variability, their applications, advantages and disadvantages. We have also suggested different methods about how to achieve a multidimensional approximation to motor variability. Finally, we have called attention to some methodological issues frequently reported as important aspects to take into account when measuring human movement variability.},

Skilled street dancers and nondancers were required to synchronize a knee-bending movement in a standing position to a metronome beat. The dancer group showed significantly smaller variability of temporal deviation (defined as the peak knee-flexion time minus beat onset time), and lower level of muscle cocontraction analyzed by electromyographic data of the agonist and antagonist muscles of the upper and lower leg than did the nondancer group. In addition, multiple regression analyses revealed that the group effect significantly predicted the level of muscle cocontraction. These results show that the level of muscle cocontraction in the lower limbs during whole-body sensorimotor synchronization movement is associated with the degree of proficiency of the

abstract = {Documentation that dancers have better balance abilities than nondancers is important because of the number of dancers who sustain injury and then are referred to physical therapists for treatment. The purpose of this study was to compare balance abilities of professional dancers with nondancers on selected balance conditions. Fifteen dancers and 15 age- and gender-matched nondancers maintained one-legged stance under six combinations of visual and support surface conditions (Foam and Dome Test modified from two feet to one foot). Each condition was maintained for 30 seconds. A composite balance score was obtained for each subject by summing the number of seconds the individual maintained balance for each test condition. There was a significant difference in the mean composite balance score (across the six balance conditions) for the dance group compared with the control group (731 seconds and 563 seconds, respectively). Under sensory challenged conditions, it appeared that dancers were better 
able to maintain their postures upright against gravity. The balance strategies and techniques learned by professional dancers should be carefully analyzed to determine if they could be incorporated into treatment programs for nondancers who have balance instability and dancers who are injured.},

Objective measurement of the accuracy in position-matching at the shoulder and elbow in both dominant and nondominant arms consisted of photographic record of the position-matching test, with goniometric measurement. SETTINGS: Physiotherapy department at the Birmingham Royal Ballet and School of Health Science, University of Birmingham. SUBJECTS: Two subject groups: physiotherapy students (n = 10), professional ballet dancers (n = 10). RESULTS: A mixed design analysis of variance found significant differences between the accuracy in position-matching at both the shoulder and elbow joints in the two groups (p < 0.05), with the ballet dancers having greater accuracy then the physiotherapy students. A significant difference in the joint positions tested were demonstrated (p < 0.05) with the positions of abduction 
at the shoulder and extension of the elbow showing greatest accuracy in matching. There was no significant difference found between the dominant and nondominant upper limb in position-matching. CONCLUSION: Professional ballet dancers demonstrated greater accuracy in position-matching the upper limb, implying that mass and continuing practice can improve a motor sensory skill.},

abstract = {This paper reports the design and implementation of a proximity sensor based floor that is capable of tracking a dancer’s steps, transmitting these to a linked computer for analysis and/or to drive other media. The design rational is outlined in the light of previous dance floors that have been developed to control performance. The aim is to develop the floor- space for recording and representing dance: for use in dance research programmes, choreographic experimentation, performance and musical composition.},

@article{Tessendorf2011,
abstract = {In the sport of rowing athletes and coaches are concerned with optimizing a rower's technique in order to improve rowing performance. In this paper, we present the design and real-world evaluation of a sensor network approach to support improving the rower's performance. In cooperation with professional rowing teams, we found that a network of inertial measurement units (IMUs) is well suited to continuously and unobtrusively monitor important indicators relating to rowing technique. In a feasibility study with 5 participants we first investigated the optimal sensor setup, and in the final setup we attached 3 IMUs to the oars and the boat. From 18 participants (including both ambitious amateurs and world-class rowers) we recorded both training and racing sessions which each consisted of 1000m rowing. We present 4 rowing technique indicators for all 18 participants. Using the example of two world-class rowers we demonstrate in detail how sensor networks support the iterative process of optimizing the individual rowing technique.},

Work on nonlinear PCA, or NLPCA, can be divided into the utilization of autoassociative neural networks, principal curves and manifolds, kernel approaches or the combination of these approaches. This article reviews existing algorithmic work, shows how a given data set can be examined to determine whether a conceptually more demanding NLPCA model is required and lists developments of NLPCA algorithms. Finally, the paper outlines problem areas and challenges that require future work to mature the NLPCA research field.},

@article{Roweis2000,
abstract = {Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

@article{Uzal2011,
abstract = {In this work we propose an objective function to guide the search for a state space reconstruction of a dynamical system from a time series of measurements. These statistics can be evaluated on any reconstructed attractor, thereby allowing a direct comparison among different approaches: (uniform or nonuniform) delay vectors, PCA, Legendre coordinates, etc. It can also be used to select the most appropriate parameters of a reconstruction strategy. In the case of delay coordinates this translates into finding the optimal delay time and embedding dimension from the absolute minimum of the advocated cost function. Its definition is based on theoretical arguments on noise amplification, the complexity of the reconstructed attractor, and a direct measure of local stretch which constitutes an irrelevance measure. The proposed method is demonstrated on synthetic and experimental time series.},
