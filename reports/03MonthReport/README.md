## 1 Report Requirements

## 1.1
It must demonstrate that the student has started working on their PhD meaningfully. It must therefore at least address the following questions:  
- What is the PhD topic about (project background and research question)?  
- What is the initial aim and what are the objectives of the PhD?  
- What is the state-of-the-art in the literature and how the PhD aims to advance this?  

## 1.2
The report should be 1 page long (A4, at least 11pt font), and therefore only one paragraph should be devoted to answering each of the above questions. Additionally, the report should include appendices covering:  
A diagrammatic workplan to 9 months (Gantt chart)  
An ethics review (if required for the PhD).  
A risk assessment of the PhD project (please note that a separate risk assessment is needed for any new experiment in the lab).   


## 1.3 Assessment
The Three-Month report will be assessed by the supervisor(s) and independent assessor (approached by the main supervisor) via email or Canvas, with any feedback being given to the PhD student normally within 4 weeks of the date of submission.

## 1.4 Outcomes
If the rate of progress is deemed to be satisfactory and the quality of the work is up to the expected standard, then the PhD student proceeds to the next milestone; if not, the supervisor(s) and independent assessors will suggest a recovery plan, notify the School Postgraduate Tutor, and the PhD student proceeds to the next milestone under caution.
