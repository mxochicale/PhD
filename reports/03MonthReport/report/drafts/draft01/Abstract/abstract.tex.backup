\begin{abstract}

The approaches for Human Activity Recognition 
varies almost as much as the types of activities that have been recognized 
and types of sensor data that have been used, 
to which we hypothesise that concepts from chaos theory
could be a powerful tool to tackle such inconveniences. Henceforth, 
this research proposal is focused on the fully understanding of the concepts from 
Chaos theory that can be used for human activity recognition so as to provide a 
robust approach for real-time applications using two inertial sensors: 
one wrist-worn and one ankle-worn. Finding appropriate methods for characterization 
and classification of human body actions is not only motivated by the fact that the 
motion capture system should be non-intrusive and easy-to-worn 
but also that theoretical approach should be well suited for real-time applications.
