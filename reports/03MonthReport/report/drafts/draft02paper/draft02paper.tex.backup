\section{Introduction}

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been a challenging task \cite{Aggarwal2004}, 
since human body activity is complex and highly diverse \cite{Kim2010}.
HAR has many potential applications; for instance, these can be seen in personal 
assistants, surveillance, patient monitoring, sports analysis, dance activities, 
human-robot interaction and biometrics to mention but a few \cite{Aggarwal2011}. 
HAR has given several frameworks in recognizing primitive activities 
such as walking, jogging, cycling, jumping; nonetheless, little work has been been
done in identifying complex activities that for instance involve dance. 

Dance activities reflects the dancer's profile i.e., rhythmic sense, 
home country \cite{Iwai2011}, personality, biological features (i.e., genre and age),
dancing skills (i.e., fluency of the motion, adding erractical or additional movements,
coordination and turbulence in dance, steadynees of the rhythm, predictability of 
the motion) \cite{GrammerK.ElisabethOberzaucher2011}.
Henceforth, for the current PhD work
we are focusing on the multiattribute classification of dancing activities 
since these are complex and  highly dinamyc activities to identify.

On the other hand, HAR deals with many issues which are
a) the different types of activities to recongnise,
b) the selection of motion capture system which should be unobtrusive and inexpensive,
c) the selection of algorithms for feature extraction and classification,
d) and the response time (offline or online) \cite{Lara2013}.
Yet, the chosen approach varies almost as greatly as the types of activities 
that have been recognized and types of sensor data that have been used 
\cite{Kim2010}. Additionally, HAR has many challenges that motivate our work 
to find new techniques in order to recognize activities in more realistic conditions. 
Therefore, finding appropriate methods for HAR is not only motivated by the 
fact that the motion capture system should be non-intrusive and easy-to-wear
but also that theoretical approach should be well suited for real-time applications.


We therefore hyphotesise that this work has the potential to 
make a major contribution to the human activity recogntion field

% Thus, the aim of the PhD is focused on a full understanding 
% of the concepts from nonlinear dynamics that can be used 
% as a feature extraction for machine learning algorithms so as to provide 
% a robust HAR approach for real-time applications using inertial sensors.

This three month report is organised as follows: First,
the state-of-the-art in motion capture systems, machine learning approaches in HAR
and human body analysis using nonlinear dynamics are reviewed in Section 2. Sencond, 
the proposed framework and the workplan is presented in section 3.

\section{Previous Work}

The central goal of the research proposal is focused on a full understanding of 
concepts from nonlinear dynamics that can be used for human activity recognition 
so as to provide a robust approach for real-time identification using inertial sensors.
Thus, reviews of motion capture systems are presented. Additionally, 
different approaches for HAR 
that use concepts from nonlinear dynamics are reviewed. 

\subsection{Motion Capture Systems}
Motion capture systems can be chategorised into three approaches: 
vision-based \cite{Forsyth2005}; 
floor-sensor based
\cite{Paradiso1997,Steinhage2008,Aguilar2007,Wimmer2011,Yin2003,Moere2004,
Richardson2004,Srinivasan2005, Rangarajan2008,Visell2010, Rajalingham2010}
; and inertial-sensor based
\cite{Razak2012,Bamberg2008,Benocci2009,Xu2012,Holleczek2010}.
Although vision-based and floor-sensor based are rooted in non-intrusive 
motion capture systems, these are still required to be used into the space 
where users are constrained to move around.
On the other hand, wearable systems have been proven to be the least instrusive 
and easy-to-use sensors. However, the choosen approach for human activity 
recognition varies as greately as the 
types of activities that have been recognized 
and many other factors such as type of sensors, data connection protocol, obstrusiveness, 
recognition performance, energy consumption, flexibility, computational processing,
features, learning, and accuracy 
are considered for the performance of the motion capture system \cite{Lara2013}.

\subsection{Machine Learning Aproaches in HAR}
Much attention has also been given in recent years to use machine learning 
algorithms in HAR since the identification of activities entail a large number of 
attribute values and different transition points between activities;
to this end several approaches have been used i.e. 
Suppor Vector Machines \cite{J.FrankS.Mannor2010, Sama2013, Schuldt2004},
template matching \cite{Nguyen2009,Lin2007}, 
Hidden Markov Model 
\cite{Kohn2012,Niu2004,Chen2003,Bernardin2003,Eickeler1998,Chang2000},
Dynamic Time Warping \cite{Bautista2013,Boulgouris2004,Celebi2011},
Neural Networks \cite{Rosenblum1994,Ji2013,Modi2011,Boesnach2004},
and  most recently Dynamic Bayesian Networks \cite{Cuaya2013, Wang2014}, 
Emerging Patterns \cite{Tao2009, Kim2010},
Conditional Random Field  \cite{Wang2006} and
Skip Change Conditional Random Field \cite{Kim2010}. 
However, much research remains to be done to find suitable approaches 
in identifying activities in more realistic conditions.


\subsection{Human Body Analysis Using Nonlinear Dynamics}

Recently, the use of intertial-based motion capture system in human body activity 
and gait recognition has been proposed the use of concepts from nonlinear dynamics 
that implements methods to obtain; for instance, the state space reconstruction,
determinism test, Lyapunov exponents and Poincar\'e maps.
These concepts have been proven to be efficient approaches to meet the computitional 
requirements for processing information in real time
\cite{J.FrankS.Mannor2010, Sama2013, Gouwanda2012,Perc2005, Akiduki2013,Akiduki2014}. 

Similarly, video-based approaches have been proven to present good results 
to recognize more complex human body activities such as the dextery of tennis players 
using attractors and fractal properties \cite{Yamamoto2000,Suzuki2013} 
, identification of dancing ballet, jumping, running, sitting and walking activities
using the attractors of the reconstructed state space, 
multivariate phase space reconstruction
and Maximal Lyapunov Exponent 
\cite{Ali2007,Basharat2009,Venkataraman2013}, and the recongnition of 
two-dimensional single-stroke patterns of 26 letters 
through modeling the attractor behaviors \cite{Ijspeert2013}. 

On the other hand, concepts from nonlinear dynamics also have been used to understand 
the behavior of human body activities for clinical applications, for instance
Vieten \emph{et al.} \cite{Vieten2013} quantify differences between gait patterns 
under constraints by approximating the time series data that underlying limit cycle 
attractors. 
Harbourne \emph{et al.} \cite{Harbourne2009} presented evidence 
to make diferentiation between health and nonhealth subjects and 
to identify difference between young and old people 
by analysing the changes in the attractor in the state space.
Zhang \textit{et al.} \cite{Zhang2010} demonstrated that the points of the 
Poincar\'e section are highly susceptible to noise; however, the use of power 
spectrum density analysis of the correlation coefficient demonstrate a relationship 
between $1/f$ noise and healthy subjects is very strong.
Buzzi \textit{et al.} \cite{Buzzi2003} demonstrated satisfactorily that elderly 
subjects increased the inability to compensate the natural stride-to-stride variations
by using the Lyapnov Exponent (LyE) and surrogate LyE (s-LyE).
Terrier \textit{et al.} \cite{Terrier2013} analysed and characterized the 
synchronization of steps with an auditory stimulus to evaluate gait stability 
and fall risk by using the maximum LyE.
It is important to mention that researchers in this area have been made 
a greater emphasis on the need for embedded software to make accessible 
tools for physical therapist.


\section{Proposed Framework and Timeline}


The proposed framework is divided into five modules (Figure \ref{fig:proposedapproach}): 
1) Data acquistion using a Bluetooth body sensor network with Inertial Measurement Units, 
2) Reconstruction of the state space with a C++ class, 
3) nonlinear measuraments and feature extractions by means of Principal Component
Analysis, 
4) classification using state-of-the-art multiatribute machine learning algorithms, 
and  5) application(s) such as dancing. 
Based on the proposed framework, 
tasks for the following 6 months are planned as follows:
\begin{itemize}
% [noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
%  \item T1: 5 curses will be taken and they will be suggested by the doctoral committee.
