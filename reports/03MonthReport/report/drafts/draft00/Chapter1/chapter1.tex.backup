Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been a challenging task \cite{Aggarwal2004}, 
since human activity is complex and highly diverse \cite{Kim2010}.
HAR has many potential applications; for instance, these can be seen in personal 
assistants, surveillance, patient monitoring, sports analysis, dance activities, 
human-robot interaction and biometrics to mention but a few \cite{Aggarwal2011}. 
HAR has been provided several frameworks in recognizing primitive activities 
such as walking, jogging, cycling, jumping; nonetheless, few work has been been
done in identifying complex activities. 



\cite{GrammerK.ElisabethOberzaucher2011}

Henceforth, for the current PhD work
we are focusing on indentifying dancing activities since these are complex and 
highly dinamical activities to identify.

On the other hand, HAR deals with many issues which are
a) the different types of activities to recongnise,
b) the selection of motion capture system being unobtrusive and inexpensive,
c) the selection of algorithms for feature extraction and classification,
d) and the responding time (offline or online) \cite{Lara2013}.
Yet, the chosen approach varies almost as greatly as the types of activities 
that have been recognized and types of sensor data that have been used 
\cite{Kim2010}. Additionally, HAR has got many challenges that motive our work 
to find new techniques in order to recognize activities in a more realistic conditions. 
Therefore, finding appropriate methods for HAR is not only motivated by the 
fact that the motion capture system should be non-intrusive and easy-to-worn 
but also that theoretical approach should be well suited for real-time applications.

% %%MOTION CAPTURE SYSTEMS
% There is extensive literature for motion capture systems for HAR, namely:
% vision-based 
% \cite{Forsyth2005,Reddy2012,Wang2006,Kim2011,Duric2002,Oikonomidis2012}; 
% floor-sensor based \cite{Paradiso1997, Steinhage2008, Aguilar2007,
% Wimmer2011,Yin2003,Moere2004,Richardson2004,
% Srinivasan2005,Rangarajan2008,Visell2010, Rajalingham2010};
% and intertial and foot-sensor based
% \cite{Razak2012, Bamberg2008,Benocci2009,Xu2012,Holleczek2010}.
% Of these, the latter being the least intrusive and sensors are easy-to-worn for dancing
% activities.

% %%SIGNAL CHARACTERIZATION
% The signal characterization in HAR considers time-domain (mean, standard deviation, 
% variance, interqualite range, mean absolute deviation, correlation between axes, 
% entropy and kurtosis), frequency-domain (Fourier Transform and 
% Discrete Cosine Transform),
% others (Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis
% and Recurrent Qualitative Analysis \cite{GrammerK.ElisabethOberzaucher2011} ) 
% for feature extraction.
% Most recently, concepts from the nonlinear dynamics such as
% time-delay embedding \cite{J.FrankS.Mannor2010, Sama2013, Ali2007, Basharat2009},
%  Lyaponov exponents \cite{Ali2007}, cylindrical phase space, 
%  H\'enon maps and Poincar\'e maps \cite{Suzuki2013}
% have been shown to posses powerful features in activity recogntion tasks, 
% especially given the need for small memory and processing requirements of
% the current devices.

% %%MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
% It has also given much attention in recent years 
% the use of machine learning algorithms in HAR
% since the activities to identify entail a large number of attribute values
% and there are different transition points between activities;
% to this end several approaches have been proposed i.e. 
% Suppor Vector Machines \cite{J.FrankS.Mannor2010, Sama2013, Schuldt2004},
% template matching \cite{Nguyen2009,Lin2007}, 
% Hidden Markov Model 
% \cite{Kohn2012,Niu2004,Chen2003,Bernardin2003,
% Eickeler1998,Chang2000},
% Dynamic Time Warping \cite{Bautista2013,Boulgouris2004,Celebi2011},
% Neural Networks \cite{Rosenblum1994,Ji2013,Modi2011,Boesnach2004},
% and  most recently 
% Dynamic Bayesian Networks \cite{Cuaya2013, Wang2014}, 
% Emerging Patterns \cite{Tao2009, Kim2010},
% Conditional Random Field  \cite{Wang2006} and
% Skip Change Conditional Random Field \cite{Kim2010}.

% We hypothesise that concepts from chaos theory
% could be a powerful tool to tackle such inconveniences.

% PhD will extend the field in two significant ways. First,
% by focusing on the complex activities involved in dance, 
% the project will address challenges in data and analysis which
% are beyond contemporary research. Second, by applying concepts 
% from non-linear dynamics, the research will create novel analysis
% and intepretation of these data. The work has the potential
% to make a major contribution to activity recogntion research.

Thus, the aim of the PhD is focused on a fully understanding 
of the concepts from non-linear dynamics that can be used 
as a feature extraction for machine learning algorithms so as to provide 
a robust HAR approach for real-time applications using inertial sensors.

To fulfill the previous-stated aim, the following research questions will be addressed:
\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
  \item 
% Most recently, concepts from the nonlinear dynamics such as
% time-delay embedding \cite{J.FrankS.Mannor2010, Sama2013, Ali2007, Basharat2009},
% Lyaponov exponents \cite{Ali2007}, cylindrical phase space, 
% H\'enon maps and Poincar\'e maps \cite{Suzuki2013}
% have been shown to posses powerful features in activity recogntion tasks, 
  
  Which non-reported concepts from chaos theory could be use to obtain 
	another features in human body analysis?
  \item Passive dynamic walking model has been used to investigate nonlinear gait 
	dynamic \cite{Kurz2007}. 
	Does the development of models for diffent human body activities 
	would be an accurate approach for real-time recognition?
  \item Would be suitable to build models based on the reconstructed attractors 
	\cite{Nikulchev2013} for different human body activities in real-time 
	applications?
  \item It has been reported that up to 50 human activities can be recongnized using 
	video based approached \cite{Reddy2012}.
	How many human body activities and with what accuracy can be recognized
	using the current proposal?
  \item How can motion for the wrist and the ankle be quantified so as to set features 
	for the better HAR?
  \item Which axis(es) among accelerations, gyroscope and magnetometer 
	will provide the best information for different human body activities?
\end{enumerate}

Given this questions, this research proposal is organised as follows: First,
the state-of-the-art in human body activities using Chaos theory is reviewed. Sencond, 
the propose framework is presented, and finally the workplan is explained using a gantt chart.
