@article{Sama2010,
abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for the auto- matic estimation of spatio temporal gait properties from signals provided by inertial body sensors. The approach is based on time series analysis. Here, a minimum number of body sensor devices is used, which imposes limitations for the automatic extraction of relevant properties of the gait like step length and velocity. The human gait is represented as a dynamical system (DS), which internal states are hidden. Sensor information is interpreted as an observation of a particular trajectory of the DS, from wich a reconstruction space can be obtained. The reconstruction space is then transformed using standard principal components analysis (PCA). From the transformed space, reliable models to estimate step length and velocities are successfully constructed. I.},

@article{Kurz2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several investigations have suggested that changes in the nonlinear gait dynamics are related to the neural control of locomotion. However, no investigations have provided insight on how neural control of the locomotive pattern may be directly reflected in changes in the nonlinear gait dynamics. Our simulations with a passive dynamic walking model predicted that toe-off impulses that assist the forward motion of the center of mass influence the nonlinear gait dynamics. Here we tested this prediction in humans as they walked on the treadmill while the forward progression of the center of mass was assisted by a custom built mechanical horizontal actuator.

METHODS: Nineteen participants walked for two minutes on a motorized treadmill as a horizontal actuator assisted the forward translation of the center of mass during the stance phase. All subjects walked at a self-select speed that had a medium-high velocity. The actuator provided assistive forces equal to 0, 3, 6 and 9 percent of the participant's body weight. The largest Lyapunov exponent, which measures the nonlinear structure, was calculated for the hip, knee and ankle joint time series. A repeated measures one-way analysis of variance with a t-test post hoc was used to determine significant differences in the nonlinear gait dynamics.

RESULTS: The magnitude of the largest Lyapunov exponent systematically increased as the percent assistance provided by the mechanical actuator was increased.

CONCLUSION: These results support our model's prediction that control of the forward progression of the center of mass influences the nonlinear gait dynamics. The inability to control the forward progression of the center of mass during the stance phase may be the reason the nonlinear gait dynamics are altered in pathological populations. However, these conclusions need to be further explored at a range of walking speeds.},

%%Dynamic Bayesian Networks
@article{Cuaya2013,
abstract = {Pathological and age-related changes may affect an individual's gait, in turn raising the risk of falls. In elderly, falls are common and may eventuate in severe injuries, long-term disabilities, and even death. Thus, there is interest in estimating the risk of falls from gait analysis. Estimation of the risk of falls requires consideration of the longitudinal evolution of different variables derived from human gait. Bayesian networks are probabilistic models which graphically express dependencies among variables. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are a type of BN adequate for modeling the dynamics of the statistical dependencies in a set of variables. In this work, a DBN model incorporates gait derived variables to predict the risk of falls in elderly within 6 months subsequent to gait assessment. Two DBNs were developed; the first (DBN1; expert-guided) was built using gait variables identified by domain experts, whereas the second (DBN2; strictly computational) was constructed utilizing gait 
variables picked out by a feature selection algorithm. The effectiveness of the second model to predict falls in the 6 months following assessment is 72.22\%. These results are encouraging and supply evidence regarding the usefulness of dynamic probabilistic models in the prediction of falls from pathological gait.},

abstract = {We consider the automated recognition of human actions in surveillance videos. Most current methods build classifiers based on complex handcrafted features computed from the raw inputs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep model that can act directly on the raw inputs. However, such models are currently limited to handling 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation combines information from all channels. To further boost the performance, we propose regularizing the outputs with high-level features and combining the predictions of a variety of different models. We apply the developed models to recognize human actions in the real-world 
environment of airport surveillance videos, and they achieve superior performance in comparison to baseline methods.},

Information derived from such pressure measures is important in gait and posture research for diagnosing lower limb problems, footwear design, sport biomechanics, injury prevention and other applications. This paper reviews foot plantar sensors characteristics as reported in the literature in addition to foot plantar pressure measurement systems applied to a variety of research problems. Strengths and limitations of current systems are discussed and a wireless foot plantar pressure system is proposed suitable for measuring high pressure distributions under the foot with high accuracy and reliability. The novel system is based on highly linear pressure sensors with no hysteresis.},

abstract = {We describe a wireless wearable system that was developed to provide quantitative gait analysis outside the confines of the traditional motion laboratory. The sensor suite includes three orthogonal accelerometers, three orthogonal gyroscopes, four force sensors, two bidirectional bend sensors, two dynamic pressure sensors, as well as electric field height sensors. The "GaitShoe" was built to be worn in any shoe, without interfering with gait and was designed to collect data unobtrusively, in any environment, and over long periods. The calibrated sensor outputs were analyzed and validated with results obtained simultaneously from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Biomotion Laboratory. The GaitShoe proved highly capable of detecting heel-strike and toe-off, as well as estimating foot orientation and position, inter alia.},

@article{Ijspeert2013,
abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems have been used in many disciplines to model complex behaviors, including biological motor control, robotics, perception, economics, traffic prediction, and neuroscience. While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence 
of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.},

@article{Vieten2013,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new method to expressly use live/corporeal data in quantifying differences of time series data with an underlying limit cycle attractor; and apply it using an example of gait data. Our intention is to identify gait pattern differences between diverse situations and classify them on group and individual subject levels. First we approximated the limit cycle attractors, from which three measures were calculated: $\delta$M amounts to the difference between two attractors (a measure for the differences of two movements), $\delta$D computes the difference between the two associated deviations of the state vector away from the attractor (a measure for the change in movement variation), and $\delta$F, a combination of the previous two, is an index of the change. As an application we quantified these measures for walking on a treadmill under three different conditions: normal walking, dual task walking, and walking with additional weights at the ankle. The new method was able 
to successfully differentiate between the three walking conditions. Day to day repeatability, studied with repeated trials approximately one week apart, indicated excellent reliability for $\delta$M (ICC(ave) > 0.73 with no differences across days; p > 0.05) and good reliability for $\delta$D (ICC(ave) = 0.414 to 0.610 with no differences across days; p > 0.05). Based on the ability to detect differences in varying gait conditions and the good repeatability of the measures across days, the new method is recommended as an alternative to expensive and time consuming techniques of gait classification assessment. In particular, the new method is an easy to use diagnostic tool to quantify clinical changes in neurological patients.},

Because mounting evidence supports the necessity of variability for health and functional movement, this perspective article argues for changes in the way therapists view variability, both in theory and in action. By providing clinical examples, as well as applying existing knowledge about complex systems, the aim of this article is to create a springboard for new directions in physical therapist research and practice.},

@article{Dingwell2000,
abstract = {Characterizing locomotor dynamics is essential for understanding the neuromuscular control of locomotion. In particular, quantifying dynamic stability during walking is important for assessing people who have a greater risk of falling. However, traditional biomechanical methods of defining stability have not quantified the resistance of the neuromuscular system to perturbations, suggesting that more precise definitions are required. For the present study, average maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents were estimated to quantify the local dynamic stability of human walking kinematics. Local scaling exponents, defined as the local slopes of the correlation sum curves, were also calculated to quantify the local scaling structure of each embedded time series. Comparisons were made between overground and motorized treadmill walking in young healthy subjects and between diabetic neuropathic (NP) patients and healthy controls (CO) during overground walking. A modification of the method of surrogate data 
was developed to examine the stochastic nature of the fluctuations overlying the nominally periodic patterns in these data sets. Results demonstrated that having subjects walk on a motorized treadmill artificially stabilized their natural locomotor kinematics by small but statistically significant amounts. Furthermore, a paradox previously present in the biomechanical literature that resulted from mistakenly equating variability with dynamic stability was resolved. By slowing their self-selected walking speeds, NP patients adopted more locally stable gait patterns, even though they simultaneously exhibited greater kinematic variability than CO subjects. Additionally, the loss of peripheral sensation in NP patients was associated with statistically significant differences in the local scaling structure of their walking kinematics at those length scales where it was anticipated that sensory feedback would play the greatest role. Lastly, stride-to-stride fluctuations in the walking patterns of all three subject 
groups were clearly distinguishable from linearly autocorrelated Gaussian noise. As a collateral benefit of the methodological approach taken in this study, some of the first steps at characterizing the underlying structure of human locomotor dynamics have been taken. Implications for understanding the neuromuscular control of locomotion are discussed. (c) 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Reliable characterization of locomotor dynamics of human walking is vital to understanding the neuromuscular control of human locomotion and disease diagnosis. However, the inherent oscillation and ubiquity of noise in such non-strictly periodic signals pose great challenges to current methodologies. To this end, we exploit the state-of-the-art technology in pattern recognition and, specifically, dimensionality reduction techniques, and propose to reconstruct and characterize the dynamics accurately on the cycle scale of the signal. This is achieved by deriving a low-dimensional representation of the cycles through global optimization, which effectively preserves the topology of the cycles that are embedded in a high-dimensional Euclidian space. Our approach demonstrates a clear advantage in capturing the intrinsic dynamics and probing the subtle synchronization patterns from uni/bivariate oscillatory signals over traditional methods. Application to human gait data for healthy subjects and 
diabetics reveals a significant difference in the dynamics of ankle movements and ankle-knee coordination, but not in knee movements. These results indicate that the impaired sensory feedback from the feet due to diabetes does not influence the knee movement in general, and that normal human walking is not critically dependent on the feedback from the peripheral nervous system.},

@article{Schuldt2004,
abstract = { Local space-time features capture local events in video and can be adapted to the size, the frequency and the velocity of moving patterns. In this paper, we demonstrate how such features can be used for recognizing complex motion patterns. We construct video representations in terms of local space-time features and integrate such representations with SVM classification schemes for recognition. For the purpose of evaluation we introduce a new video database containing 2391 sequences of six human actions performed by 25 people in four different scenarios. The presented results of action recognition justify the proposed method and demonstrate its advantage compared to other relative approaches for action recognition.},
