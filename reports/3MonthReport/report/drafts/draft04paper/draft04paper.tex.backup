\section{Introduction}
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been a challenging task \cite{Aggarwal2004}, 
since human body activity is complex and highly diverse \cite{Kim2010}.
One of the challenges is that, unlike speech, we do not have a single model 
of how the signal is produced.  
This either means that we have to create unique generation models for all types 
of activity, or we have to ignore generation models in favour of 
finding patterns in the data.  While both approaches are commonly used, 
they do tend to limit how well the field of HAR can advance. 

HAR has given several frameworks in recognizing primitive activities 
such as walking, jogging, cycling, jumping; nonetheless, little work has been been
done in identifying complex activities that for instance involve dance. 
Dance activities reflects the dancer's profile i.e., rhythmic sense, 
home country \cite{Iwai2011}, personality, biological features (i.e., genre and age),
dancing skills (i.e., fluency of the motion, adding erractical or additional movements,
coordination and turbulence in dance, steadynees of the rhythm, predictability of 
the motion) \cite{GrammerK.ElisabethOberzaucher2011}.
Recently, researchers in human body activity and gait recognition have proposed
the use of concepts from nonlinear dynamics (\textit{e.g.}
time-delay embedding theorem \cite{J.FrankS.Mannor2010,Sama2013}
and attractors in the state space \cite{Akiduki2013,Akiduki2014}) 
that have been proven to be an efficient approach 
for classification purposes as well as for indentification activities 
in real time in low-powered devices. 

Henceforth, the current PhD work is aimed to gain understanding of 
concepts from nonlinear dynamics that can be used to extract features and
to address the multiattribute classification problem that is involved 
in dance activities.

\subsection{Research Questions}
HAR deals with many issues which are
a) the different types of activities to recongnise,
b) the selection of motion capture system which should be unobtrusive and inexpensive,
c) the selection of algorithms for feature extraction and classification,
d) and the response time (offline or online) \cite{Lara2013}.
Yet, the chosen approach varies almost as greatly as the types of activities 
that have been recognized and types of sensor data that have been used 
\cite{Kim2010}. 
Additionally, HAR has many challenges that motivate our work 
to find new techniques in order to recognize activities in more realistic conditions. 
Therefore, finding appropriate methods for HAR is not only motivated by the 
fact that the motion capture system should be non-intrusive and easy-to-wear
but also that theoretical approach should be well suited for real-time applications.

To fullfil the previous-stated seatbacks, the following research questions will be addressed:

\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
  \item Which concepts from nonlinear dynamics could be use to obtain 
	another features for human body analysis?
  \item How can motion of the body parts (wrist, ankle, hips, shoulders, etc)
        be quantified so as to set features for the better characterization
        and identification of the human body activities?
%   \item Which axes among accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer 
% 	will provide the best information to identify complex activities?
%   \item Which machine learning algorithm would be more suitable to identify complex 
%     activities such as dancing.
  \item How do common machine learning algorithms relate to the data collected 
  from dancing, and how does the output of these algorithms compare and contrast 
  with the results from nonlinear dynamics?
%   \item Passive dynamic walking model has been used to investigate nonlinear gait 
% 	dynamic \cite{Kurz2007}. 
% 	Does the development of models for diffent human body activities 
% 	would be an accurate approach for real-time recognition?
%   \item Would be suitable to build models based on the reconstructed attractors 
% 	\cite{Nikulchev2013} for different human body activities in real-time 
% 	applications?
%   \item It has been reported that up to 50 human activities can be recongnized using 
% 	video based approached \cite{Reddy2012}.
% 	How many human body activities and with what accuracy can be recognized
% 	using the current proposal?
\end{enumerate}

% We therefore hyphotesise that this work has the potential to 
% make a major contribution to the human activity recogntion field
% 
% Thus, the aim of the PhD is focused on a full understanding 
% of the concepts from nonlinear dynamics that can be used 
% as a feature extraction for machine learning algorithms so as to provide 
% a robust HAR approach for real-time applications using inertial sensors.

% This three month report is organised as follows: First,
% the state-of-the-art in motion capture systems, machine learning approaches in HAR
% and human body analysis using nonlinear dynamics are reviewed in Section 2. Sencond, 
% the proposed framework and the workplan is presented in section 3.

% are presented. Additionally, 
% different approaches for HAR 
% that use concepts from nonlinear dynamics are reviewed. 

\subsection{Motion Capture Systems}
Motion capture systems can be chategorised into three approaches: 
vision-based \cite{Forsyth2005}; 
floor-sensor based
\cite{Paradiso1997,Steinhage2008,Aguilar2007,Wimmer2011,Yin2003,Moere2004,
Richardson2004,Srinivasan2005, Rangarajan2008,Visell2010, Rajalingham2010}
; and inertial-sensor based
\cite{Razak2012,Bamberg2008,Benocci2009,Xu2012,Holleczek2010}.
Although vision-based and floor-sensor based are rooted in non-intrusive 
motion capture systems, these are still required to be used into the space 
where users are constrained to move around.
On the other hand, wearable systems have been proven to be the least instrusive 
and easy-to-use sensors. However, the choosen approach for 
the motion capture system varies as greately as the 
types of activities that have been recognized 
and many other factors such as type of sensors, data connection protocol, obstrusiveness, 
recognition performance, energy consumption, flexibility, computational processing,
features, learning, and accuracy 
are considered for the performance of the motion capture system \cite{Lara2013}.

\subsection{Machine Learning Aproaches in HAR}
Much attention has also been given in recent years to use machine learning 
algorithms in HAR since the identification of activities entail a large number of 
attribute values and different transition points between activities;
to this end several approaches have been used i.e. 
Suppor Vector Machines \cite{J.FrankS.Mannor2010, Sama2013, Schuldt2004},
template matching \cite{Nguyen2009,Lin2007}, 
Hidden Markov Model 
\cite{Kohn2012,Niu2004,Chen2003,Bernardin2003,Eickeler1998,Chang2000},
Dynamic Time Warping \cite{Bautista2013,Boulgouris2004,Celebi2011},
Neural Networks \cite{Rosenblum1994,Ji2013,Modi2011,Boesnach2004},
and  most recently Dynamic Bayesian Networks \cite{Cuaya2013, Wang2014}, 
Emerging Patterns \cite{Tao2009, Kim2010},
Conditional Random Field  \cite{Wang2006} and
Skip Change Conditional Random Field \cite{Kim2010}. 
However, much research remains to be done to find suitable machine learning 
algorithms to identify complex activities that are presented in dance activities.


\subsection{Human Body Analysis Using Nonlinear Dynamics}

Recently, the use of intertial-based motion capture system in human body activity 
and gait recognition has been proposed the use of concepts from nonlinear dynamics 
that implements methods to obtain; for instance, the state space reconstruction,
determinism test, Lyapunov exponents and Poincar\'e maps.
These concepts have been proven to be efficient approaches to meet the computitional 
requirements for processing information in real time
\cite{J.FrankS.Mannor2010, Sama2013, Gouwanda2012,Perc2005, Akiduki2013,Akiduki2014}. 

Similarly, video-based approaches have been proven to present good results 
to recognize more complex human body activities such as the dextery of tennis players 
using attractors and fractal properties \cite{Yamamoto2000,Suzuki2013} 
, identification of dancing ballet, jumping, running, sitting and walking activities
using the attractors of the reconstructed state space, 
multivariate phase space reconstruction
and Maximal Lyapunov Exponent 
\cite{Ali2007,Basharat2009,Venkataraman2013}, and the recongnition of 
two-dimensional single-stroke patterns of 26 letters 
through modeling the attractor behaviors \cite{Ijspeert2013}. 

On the other hand, concepts from nonlinear dynamics also have been used to understand 
the behavior of human body activities for clinical applications, for instance
Vieten \emph{et al.} \cite{Vieten2013} quantify differences between gait patterns 
under constraints by approximating the time series data that underlying limit cycle 
attractors. 
Harbourne \emph{et al.} \cite{Harbourne2009} presented evidence 
to make diferentiation between health and nonhealth subjects and 
to identify difference between young and old people 
by analysing the changes in the attractor in the state space.
Zhang \textit{et al.} \cite{Zhang2010} demonstrated that the points of the 
Poincar\'e section are highly susceptible to noise; however, the use of power 
spectrum density analysis of the correlation coefficient demonstrate a relationship 
between $1/f$ noise and healthy subjects is very strong.
Buzzi \textit{et al.} \cite{Buzzi2003} demonstrated satisfactorily that elderly 
subjects increased the inability to compensate the natural stride-to-stride variations
by using the Lyapnov Exponent (LyE) and surrogate LyE (s-LyE).
Terrier \textit{et al.} \cite{Terrier2013} analysed and characterized the 
synchronization of steps with an auditory stimulus to evaluate gait stability 
and fall risk by using the maximum LyE.
It is important to mention that researchers in this area have been made 
a greater emphasis on the need for embedded software to make accessible 
tools for physical therapist.

\section{How will the PhD advance research?}

This PhD will extend the field of HAR in three signigicant ways.
First, by analysing the time-series of the inertial sensors as a nonlinear systems, 
the research will create novel analysis of these data.
Second, by builing a Body Sensor Network, the research will create a non-intrusive motion 
capture system as well as open source software which will be suitable for online activity 
recognition in a more realistic condition. 
Third, by applying different machine learning algorithms to classify the complex activitites 
involved in dance, the research will contribute to interpretation of the data so as
to evaluate the accuracy in different classifiers.

\section{Research Methods}
\subsection{Takens's Theorem}

In this work we follow the notation employed in \cite{Casdagli1991,Uzal2012}.
The purpose of the Takens's Theorem also knowns as time-delay embedding theorem 
is to reconstruct a $D-$dimensional manifold \textbf{M} $s(t)$ of an unknown dynamical 
system from time series $x(t)$ of that system. 
The time series is a sequence $x(t)=h(s(t))$, where $h: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D$
is a measurement function on the unknown dynamical system, being $x(t)$ observable.
The time delay reconstruction in $m$ dimensions with time delay $\tau$ is defined as:
$\overline{x}(t) = (x(t), x(t-\tau),...,x(t-(m-1)\tau))$ which defines a map
$\varPhi: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ such that $\overline{x}(t) = \varPhi(s)$.
$\varPsi: \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a further transformation that
is considered as a more general transformation in which for the 
current work we are applying the Principal
Component Analyis PCA algorithm (Figure \ref{fig:takens_theorem}).

\label{fig:takens_theorem}
\end{figure}

Although the Takens's Theorem is well studied, there is still 
research to be done to find the optimal embedded parameters ($m$ and $\tau$) 
that largely depends on the application at hand \cite{J.FrankS.Mannor2010,Sama2013}.

\section{Current Progress}

\subsection{Body Sensor Network}
A body sensor network has been built using four Razor 9DOF Inertial Measurement 
Units using Bluetooth (Adeunis ARF7044).
The data is collected at a sampling rate of 50 Hz by using a C++ class. 
Both hardware and software are under development and these work on 
GNU$\backslash$Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 32 bits distribution).

\subsection{Preliminary Experiments}
By establishing a basic latin dance foot pattern as the human activity to characterize,
the user has been asked to perform this activity in repetitive times. 
The inertial sensor was worn in the right ankle.
We then collected the time series for the roll euler angle 
(Figure \ref{fig:example} (a)). 
The embedding parameters for the the time-delay embedding reconstruction 
are $m=30$, $\tau=3$. Finally, we transform the reconstructed state space
by using the PCA algorithm and plot the first three components
(Figure \ref{fig:example} (b)).
\begin{figure}[htbp!] 
\centering

\caption[PA]{(a) Time series for the roll euler angle, (b) 
First three components of PCA of the reconstructed state space with $m=30$, $\tau=3$.}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}
We are analysing the time series of different sensor position as well as 
the use of different components so as to to obtain obtimal embedded parameters
for the reconstructed state space by using Cao's method \cite{Cao1997}.


\section{6 month plan}
The proposed framework is divided into five modules (Figure \ref{fig:proposedapproach}): 
1) Data acquistion using a Bluetooth body sensor network with Inertial Measurement Units, 
2) Reconstruction of the state space with a C++ class, 
3) nonlinear measuraments and feature extractions by means of Principal Component
Analysis, 
4) classification using state-of-the-art multiatribute machine learning algorithms, 
and  5) application(s) such as dancing. 
Based on the proposed framework, 
tasks for the following 6 months are planned as follows:
