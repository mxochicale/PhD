abstract = {Information about the motor performance, i.e. how well an activity is performed, is valuable information for a variety of novel applications in Activity Recognition (AR). Its as- sessment represents a significant challenge, as requirements depend on the specific application. We develop an approach to quantify one aspect that many domains share – the ef- ficiency of motion – that has implications for signals from body-worn or pervasive sensors, as it influences the inherent complexity of the recorded multi-variate time-series. Based on the energy distribution in PCA we infer a single, nor- malised metric that is intimately linked to signal complexity and allows comparison of (subject-specific) time-series. We evaluate the approach on artificially distorted signals and apply it to a simple kitchen task to show its applicability to real-life data streams.},

The healthcare system is going through a transformation in which continuous monitoring of inhabitants is possible even without hospitalization. The advancement of sensing technologies, embedded systems, wireless communication technologies, nano technologies, and miniaturization makes it possible to develop smart systems to monitor activities of human beings continuously. Wearable sensors detect abnormal and/or unforeseen situations by monitoring physiological parameters along with other symptoms. Therefore, necessary help can be provided in times of dire need. This paper reviews the latest reported systems on activity monitoring of humans based on wearable sensors and issues to be addressed to tackle the challenges.

abstract = {Human body motion is typically captured by body area sensor networks. Accurate sensor placement with respect to anatomical landmarks is one of the main concerns in reliability of the motion capturing systems. Changes in position of sensors cause increased variability in motion data. Our goal is to isolate the characteristic features that represent the principle motion pattern. By using functional Principal Component Analysis (f-PCA) we compensate for the variation in data due to inadvertent movement of sensor placement. F-PCA is an effective tool for the study of human motion modeling by identifying hidden combinations and relationships between variables. The collected data from our experiment show differences between similar actions within different sessions of marker wearing. After applying f-PCA to the data, we show how the uncertainties due to sensor position changes can be compensated for.},

Accurate sensor placement with respect to anatomical landmarks is one of the main factors determining the accuracy of motion-capture systems. Changes in position of the sensors cause increased variability in the motion data, so isolating the characteristic features that represent the most important motion patterns is our concern. As accurate sensor placement is time-consuming and hard to achieve, we propose a signal processing technique that can enable salient data to be isolated. By using functional principal component analysis (f-PCA), we compensate for the variation in data due to changes in the on-body positioning of sensors. More precisely, we investigate the use of f-PCA for filtering and interpreting motion data, whilst accounting for variability in the sensor origin. Data are collected through a marker-based motion capture system from two designed experiments based on human body and robot arm movement. Results show differences between similar actions across different sessions of marker wearing with random changes in position of sensors. After applying the f-PCA filter on the data, we show how uncertainties due to sensor position changes can be compensated for.},

abstract = {User interface (UI) centric embedded systems such as smart phones, tablets, and smart TVs are ever proliferating. While many model-based UI development environments provide automatic UI executable generation, they are focused on web-based systems and not suitable for embedded systems. Accordingly, developers create a separate UI model for each target embedded system while failing to reuse their UI models.This paper proposes differential logical UI modeling (DLUM) that solves these difficulties. DLUM comprises (1) a graphical modeling language for logical UI model (LUM) and differential LUM, (2) a method for deriving a UI implementation by weaving a base LUM and a differential LUM, and (3) its supporting tool. DLUM enables developers to model only differential parts of UI models compared to a base model. DLU generates LUM from differential LUM, which consequently enables deriving complete UI implementations. We have fully implemented a modeling tool for DLUM as Eclipse plug-in using Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF). We have also performed a case study with an alarm application in Android targeted for multiple embedded systems with various resolutions from HVGA to XGA. The case study clearly shows how DLUM makes the modeling of UIs for embedded systems concise and allows reusing UIs for multiple embedded systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Standard inputs such as a mouse and keyboard are not well suited for these more on-the-go style systems. Gestures are seen as an effective alternative to these classical input styles. In this paper we examine two recognition gesture algorithms that use an inertial sensor worn on the forearm. The recognition algorithms use the sensor's quaternion orientation in either a Hidden Markov Model or Markov Chain based approach. A set of six gestures were selected to fit within the context of the active game. Despite the fact that the Hidden Markov Model is one of the most commonly used methods for gesture recognition, our results found that the Markov Chain algorithm outperformed the Hidden Markov Model. The Markov Chain algorithm obtained an average accuracy of 95{\%}, while also having a faster computation time, making it better suited for real time applications.},

@article{Banos2014,
abstract = {Signal segmentation is a crucial stage in the activity recognition process; however, this has been rarely and vaguely characterized so far. Windowing approaches are normally used for segmentation, but no clear consensus exists on which window size should be preferably employed. In fact, most designs normally rely on figures used in previous works, but with no strict studies that support them. Intuitively, decreasing the window size allows for a faster activity detection, as well as reduced resources and energy needs. On the contrary, large data windows are normally considered for the recognition of complex activities. In this work, we present an extensive study to fairly characterize the windowing procedure, to determine its impact within the activity recognition process and to help clarify some of the habitual assumptions made during the recognition system design. To that end, some of the most widely used activity recognition procedures are evaluated for a wide range of window sizes and activities. From the evaluation, the interval 1-2 s proves to provide the best trade-off between recognition speed and accuracy. The study, specifically intended for on-body activity recognition systems, further provides designers with a set of guidelines devised to facilitate the system definition and configuration according to the particular application requirements and target activities.},
