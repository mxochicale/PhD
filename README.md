# News
On 26th of October 2018, I submitted my PhD thesis at the University of Birmingham UK 
within the field of Computer Engineering where I investigated and analysed time 
series from inertial sensors for movement variability using nonlinear dynamics tools 
(i.e. reconstructed state space, recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis) 
in the context of human-robot interaction. 
My PhD thesis includes code and data and is available in GitHub 
(see [here](https://github.com/mxochicale/phd-thesis)). 
My PhD thesis was under the supervision of 
[Professor Chris Baber](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=MQ184fQAAAAJ&hl=en)
and 
[Professor Martin Russell](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ENFxfA0AAAAJ&hl=en)
and I passed my viva on 11th of January 2019.
